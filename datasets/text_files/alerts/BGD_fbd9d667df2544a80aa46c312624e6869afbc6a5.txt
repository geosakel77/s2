Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges given to the host machine. Depending on the privileges associated with VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMWare SD-WAN Orchestrator, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: • The SD-WAN Orchestrator does not apply correct input validation which allows for SQL-injection (CVE-2020-3984) • The SD-WAN Orchestrator allows for executing files through directory traversal (CVE-2020-4000) • The SD-WAN Orchestrator has default passwords allowing for a Pass-the-Hash Attack (CVE-2020-4001) • The SD-WAN Orchestrator allows an access to set arbitrary authorization levels leading to a privilege escalation issue (CVE-2020-3985) • The SD-WAN Orchestrator handles system parameters in an insecure way (CVE-2020-4002) • The SD-WAN Orchestrator was found to be vulnerable to SQL-injection attacks allowing for potential information disclosure (CVE-2020-4003) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges given to the host machine. Depending on the privileges associated with VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator versions prior to 4.0.1, 3.4.4, and 3.3.2 P3 RECOMMENDATIONS Following actions are recommended to be taken: • Apply appropriate patches or appropriate mitigations provided by VMware to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. • Change all default passwords on the predefined accounts. • Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. • Remind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. • Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from untrusted sources. • Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
