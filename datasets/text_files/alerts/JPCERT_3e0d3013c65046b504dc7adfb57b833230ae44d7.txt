   Alert Regarding Vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781) in Citrix Products

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2020/at200003.html


I. Overview
JPCERT/CC confirmed that information including Proof-of-Concept code
about a vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781) in Citrix Application Delivery
Controller and Citrix Gateway has been made public. A remote attacker
leveraging this vulnerability may execute arbitrary code.

On January 12, 2020 (local time), Bad Packets released information
about scanning activities that appeared to be leveraging the vulnerability.

    Bad Packets
    Over 25,000 Citrix (NetScaler) endpoints vulnerable to CVE-2019-19781
    https://badpackets.net/over-25000-citrix-netscaler-endpoints-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-19781/

JPCERT/CC has observed traffic which appeared to exploit this
vulnerability on sensors and has confirmed the attacks that seem to
exploit this vulnerability have already been conducted in Japan.
JPCERT/CC notifies organizations that are considered to be using the
affected products based on the information received from overseas
organizations. If you are using the affected products, it is
recommended to take measures as soon as possible.


II. Affected Products
Products affected by these vulnerabilities include:

  - Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway version 13.0
  - Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.1
  - Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.0
  - Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 11.1
  - Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 10.5
  - Citrix SD-WAN WANOP software and appliance model 4000
  - Citrix SD-WAN WANOP software and appliance model 4100
  - Citrix SD-WAN WANOP software and appliance model 5000
  - Citrix SD-WAN WANOP software and appliance model 5100


III. Confirmation of Breach
The method of confirming whether this vulnerability is exploited is as
follows.

(1) Check if there is any access to the device from a suspicious IP address
  - The log of HTTP traffic to the device is recorded in httpaccess.log and httperror.log

(2) Check whether traffic that exploits the vulnerability is recorded in the device log
  - If the Proof-of-Concept code that exploits this vulnerability is executed, traffic including the following string is recorded in the device.

    /vpns/
    /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf
    /vpn/../vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl
    /vpn/../vpns/portal/backdoor.xml
    /vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl

(3) Check the files under the following directory on the device
  - If there is a recently created unknown xml file, the file is a malicious file created by an attacker, it is possible that an attack has been already conducted to compromise the device.

    /var/tmp/netscaler/portal/templates
    /netscaler/portal/templates

(4) Check device processes and cron jobs
  - Execute commands on the device to check if there is any process or cron job running by the user "nobody".
  - If this vulnerability is exploited, processes are executed by a user named "nobody". If such processes are running, it is possible that an attack has been already conducted to compromise the device.

** Update: January 24, 2020 Update ***********************************
Citrix and other several vendors and researchers released information
and tool, which can be utilised in the investigation, or to search for
indicators of compromise in the system.
