IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware vCenter Server, which could result in remote code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * A remote code execution vulnerability in vCenter Server which enables a malicious actor to execute commands with unrestricted privileges. (CVE-2021-21985) * An authentication mechanism issue in vCenter Server Plug-ins which enable a malicious actor to perform unauthorized actions. (CVE-2021-21086) Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. A pre-requisite of exploiting these vulnerabilities is that the malicious actor must have network access over port 443 to exploit these vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in context of the user running the application. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * VMware vCenter Server versions 6.5, 6.7, 7.0 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates provided by VMware to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
