               Increased activity targeting TCP port 445

             http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2009/at090002.txt

I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC Internet Scan Data Acquisition System (ISDAS) has observed
that scans against TCP port 445 have been increasing since late
December of 2008. Although the cause of these scans has not been
identified yet, they may be infection attempts by worms exploiting a
Server service vulnerability in Microsoft Windows products (MS08-067),
for which a security update was released last year.

  These worms may spread via scans and removable storage devices such
as USB memory. Since scans mainly from inside Japan have been
increasing for the last several days, infection may be spreading in
Japan.


II. Observation status

  For the TCP port 445 scan trends observed by ISDAS, refer to the
following website:

III. Solution

  Users of the services running on TCP port 445 are recommended to
consider taking the following countermeasures:

   1) When using a Microsoft Windows product, apply the security
      update according to "IV. References".

   2) In order to prevent secondary damage from virus infection,
      restrict packets from internal to external TCP port 445.

  For worms spreading recently, the following should also be
considered:

   3) Not to use a vulnerable password for system and network
      authentication.

   4) Be careful about handling of removable storage devices such as
      USB memory
