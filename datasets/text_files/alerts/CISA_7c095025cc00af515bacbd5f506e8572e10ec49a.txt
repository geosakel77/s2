More Alerts Alert (SA04-033A) Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer Original release date: February 02, 2004 Systems Affected Microsoft Windows systems running Internet Explorer 5.01 Internet Explorer 5.50 Internet Explorer 6 Previous versions that are no longer supported may also be affected. Overview Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) contains multiple
vulnerabilities, the most serious of which could allow attackers in any
location to run programs of their choice on your computer using the same
privileges as you have. Quick Links Patch Information | Problem Description | References Description Microsoft's Home User Security Bulletin for 
February 2004 describes three vulnerabilities in Internet 
Explorer (IE). Note that in addition to IE, any applications that use IE to
interpret HTML documents, such as email programs, may present additional
ways for these vulnerabilities to be used. These vulnerabilities have different impacts, ranging from disguising the
true location of a URL to executing computer commands or code,
essentially taking over control of your computer and any data on it. The
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing you, the victim, to
access a specially crafted HTML document such as a web page or HTML email
message. Your computer can be compromised simply by viewing the attacker's 
HTML document with Internet Explorer. A technical description of these vulnerabilities is available from
US-CERT in TA04-033A and from Microsoft in MS04-004 . Resolution Apply a patch Microsoft has released a home user bulletin describing how to
determine what patches you will need and how to get them. Follow the
procedures outlined in Microsoft's Home User Security Bulletin for February 2004 . For additional information, and to receive updates on this alert, go to http://www.us-cert.gov .
