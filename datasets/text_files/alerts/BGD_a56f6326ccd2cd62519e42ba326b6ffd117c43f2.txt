which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Adobe Flash Player is a
widely distributed multimedia and application player used to enhance the
user experience when visiting web pages or reading email messages. Impact : Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for
arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the
application. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an
attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are
configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less
impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

System Affected:
* Adobe Flash Player Desktop Runtime versions 29.0.0.140 and earlier for
Windows, Macintosh, and Linux
* Adobe Flash Player for Google Chrome versions 29.0.0.140 and earlier
for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Chrome OS
* Adobe Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11
versions 29.0.0.140 and earlier for Windows 10 and 8.1 Mitigation :
The following actions are recommended:
* Apply the appropriate patch provided by Adobe to vulnerable systems
immediately after appropriate testing.
* Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative
privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack.
* Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided
by unknown or un-trusted sources.
* Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext
links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources.
* Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
