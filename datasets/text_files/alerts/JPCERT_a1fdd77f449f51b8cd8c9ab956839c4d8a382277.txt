On December 8, 2020, JPCERT/CC confirmed that the Proof-of-Concept
code for this vulnerability has been made public.

Microsoft plans to provide security updates for this vulnerability in
two phases. The first phase is the initial deployment phase for

At this time, in addition to applying the update on December 9, it is
necessary to change the registry setting to enforcement mode. Please
