This vulnerability affects Cisco devices running IOS XR software that have an active interface configured under multicast routing. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust process memory of an affected device. This vulnerability was detected in exploits in the wild. IMPACT An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. SYSTEM AFFECTED These vulnerabilities affect any Cisco device that is running any release of Cisco IOS XR Software if an active interface is configured under multicast routing and it is receiving DVMRP traffic. RECOMMENDATIONS Although there are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities, there are multiple mitigations available to customers depending on their needs. As a mitigation for the memory exhaustion case, it is recommended that customers implement a rate limiter. This will require that customers understand their current rate of IGMP traffic and set a rate lower than the current average rate. It is worth noting that there is a default limiter in place. In configuration mode, the customer can enter the lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate command as follows: RP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate <value> This command will not remove the exploit vector. However, the command will reduce the traffic rate and increase the time necessary for successful exploitation. The customer can use this time to perform recovery actions. As a mitigation for both the memory exhaustion case and the immediate IGMP process crash case, customers may implement an access control entry (ACE) to an existing interface access control list (ACL). Alternatively, the customer can create a new ACL for a specific interface that denies DVMRP traffic inbound on that interface. The following example creates an ACL and denies DVMRP traffic: RP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# ipv4 access-list <acl_name> deny igmp any any dvmrp REFERENCES https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/08/31/cisco-releases-security-advisory-dvmrp-vulnerability-ios-xr https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-dvmrp-memexh-dSmpdvfz https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-warns-of-actively-exploited-bugs-in-carrier-grade-routers/ Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
