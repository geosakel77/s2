recommended to check the information and take measures such as applying
countermeasures or workarounds as soon as possible.


II. Affected Products

AWS will be available shortly. Also, vulnerable virtual SMA 100 series
10.x images have been pulled from AWS and Azure marketplaces and
updated images will be re-submitted as soon as possible.

Also, due to the potential credential exposure, users are also
recommended to apply the following measures as well as updating the
version:

  - Reset the passwords for any users who may have logged in to the device via the web interface.

**********************************************************************


IV. Workarounds
Enabling MFA (multi-factor authentication) and resetting passwords as
described above are listed as workarounds.

In addition, SonicWall says enabling the built-in Web Application
Firewall (WAF) function can also mitigate the vulnerability. According
to SonicWall, 60 complimentary days of WAF enablement are added to all
registered SMA 100 series devices with 10.x code to enable this
mitigation technique.

V. Investigation for compromise

** Update: February 8, 2021 Update ***********************************
On January 31, 2021 (local time), Rich Warren, who belongs to the NCC
Group which had discovered this vulnerability, released IOC information
to help with compromise investigation.

1. Authentication bypass for access to the management interface

Look for the access log for a request to '/cgi-bin/management' that do
not have a preliminary successful request to '/__api__/v1/logon' or
'/__api__/v1/logon/
<id>
 /authenticate'. If these requests do exist, then
it could indicate an authentication bypass to the management interface.

2. Authentication bypass for access to the user interface

Look for the access log for requests to '/cgi-bin/sslvpnclient' or
'/cgi-bin/portal' that do not have a preliminary successful request to
'/cgi-bin/userLogin', '/__api__/v1/login', or
'/__api__/v1/logon/
 <id>
  /authenticate'. If such requests do exist,
then it could indicate a user-level authentication bypass.
