Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Kernel components. (CVE-2017-18509) * An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Media Framework. (CVE-2021-0332) * An arbitrary code vulnerability in Media Framework. (CVE-2021-0325) * An information disclosure vulnerability in Media Framework. (CVE-2021-0335) * An information disclosure vulnerability in Android runtime. (CVE-2021-0341) * A denial of service vulnerabilities in Framework.

(CVE-2021-0302, CVE-2021-0305, CVE-2021-0314, CVE-2021-0327, CVE-2021-0330, CVE-2021-0334, CVE-2021-0337, CVE-2021-0339, CVE-2021-0340) * An arbitrary code vulnerability in System. (CVE-2021-0326) * Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in System. (CVE-2021-0328, CVE-2021-0329, CVE-2021-0331, CVE-2021-0333, CVE-2021-0336) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Google Play system updates (CVE-2021-0311, CVE-2021-0312) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Kernel components (CVE-2020-10732, CVE-2020-10766, CVE-2020-10767) * A high severity vulnerabilities in MediaTek components (CVE-2021-0301) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm components (CVE-2020-11233, CVE-2020-11239, CVE-2020-11240, CVE-2020-11250, CVE-2020-11261, CVE-2020-11262) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm closed-source components (CVE-2020-11134, CVE-2020-11182, CVE-2020-11126, CVE-2020-11159, CVE-2020-11181, CVE-2020-11235, CVE-2020-11238, CVE-2020-11241, CVE-2020-11260) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Android OS builds utilizing Security Patch Levels issued prior to February 5, 2021 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates by Google Android or mobile carriers to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. * Remind users to only download applications from trusted vendors in the Play Store. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources.
