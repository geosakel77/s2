       https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2020/at200045.html


I. Overview
On December 3, 2020 (Local Time), Apache Software Foundation has
released information regarding a vulnerability (CVE-2020-17527) in
Apache Tomcat. According to the information, Apache Tomcat could
re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received
on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent
stream. It is possible that this could lead to the leakage between
requests, while this would most likely lead to an error and the
closure of the HTTP/2 connection.
