PHP is a programming language originally designed for use in web-based applications with HTML content. PHP supports a wide variety of platforms and is used by numerous web-based software applications. Successfully exploiting the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the affected application. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Failed exploitation could result in a denial-of-service condition. Impact : An attacker can leverage this issue to gain elevated privileges and perform unauthorized actions which may aid in launching further attacks. Mitigation : Updates are available. Please see the references or vendor advisory for more information. Recommendations : Upgrade to the latest version of PHP immediately, after appropriate testing. Verify no unauthorized system modifications have occurred on system before applying patch. Apply the principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
