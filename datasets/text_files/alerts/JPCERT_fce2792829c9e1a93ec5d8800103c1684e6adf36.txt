&lt;(1) A vulnerability known to be exploited in the wild&gt;
 According to Microsoft, among these vulnerabilities, the Windows AppX
Installer Spoofing Vulnerability (CVE-2021-43890) has been confirmed to
be exploited in the wild.

Microsoft is aware of attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability
by using specially crafted packages that include the malware such as
Emotet. Microsoft released Microsoft App Installer that has addressed
the vulnerability, and also the workarounds to mitigate the impact with
GPO.

The vulnerability was exploited in an attack where a victim connects to
an external website from a link in a malicious email's body, then clicks
a link on the website that will display a window that asks Microsoft App
Installer to install a program that looks like a trusted app, which will
ultimately lead to an infection upon installation of the malicious app.

&lt;(2) Active Directory Security Enhancement&gt;
 The security update since November 2021 includes four security
enhancements in Active Directory, and Microsoft has released reference information for Active Directory administrators.

Microsoft has pointed out that this vulnerability may be widely exploited
in the future, and JPCERT/CC is already aware of a proof-of-concept (PoC)
code that seems to exploit a part of these vulnerabilities. A user without
administrative privilege exploiting these vulnerabilities may gain domain
administrator access.
