      Microsoft Windows SMB Server that could allow for remote code
      execution. This vulnerability is due to an error in handling
      maliciously crafted compressed data packets within version 3.1.1
      of Server Message Blocks. To exploit this vulnerability, an
      attacker can send specially crafted compressed data packets to a
      target Microsoft Server Message Block 3.0 (SMBv3) server. Clients
      who connects to the malicious SMB server would then also be
      impacted. Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) is a network file
      sharing protocol that allows users or applications to request
      files and services over the network. Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability
      could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges as the
      account running the SMB server and client processes. An attacker
      could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
      create new accounts with full user rights. System Affected: * Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems * Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems * Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems * Windows 10 Version 1909 for 32-bit Systems * Windows 10 Version 1909 for ARM64-based Systems * Windows 10 Version 1909 for x64-based Systems * Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation) * Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation) Mitigation: The following actions are recommended: * Consider applying the workarounds provided by Microsoft until
      patches are released; The workaround does not mitigate attacks
      targeting SMB clients. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without
      administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful
      attack. * Remind users not to visit websites or follow links provided by
      unknown or untrusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by
      hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from
      un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and
      services.
