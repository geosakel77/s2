Note: this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of the Treasury, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are releasing this CSA to provide information on MedusaLocker ransomware. Observed as recently as May 2022, MedusaLocker actors predominantly rely on vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access victims’ networks. The MedusaLocker actors encrypt the victim's data and leave a ransom note with communication instructions in every folder containing an encrypted file. The note directs victims to provide ransomware payments to a specific Bitcoin wallet address. MedusaLocker appears to operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model based on the observed split of ransom payments. Typical RaaS models involve the ransomware developer and various affiliates that deploy the ransomware on victim systems. MedusaLocker ransomware payments appear to be consistently split between the affiliate, who receives 55 to 60 percent of the ransom; and the developer, who receives the remainder. Download the PDF version of this report: pdf, 633 kb Technical Details MedusaLocker ransomware actors most often gain access to victim devices through vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations [ T1133 ]. Actors also frequently use email phishing and spam email campaigns—directly attaching the ransomware to the email—as initial intrusion vectors [ T1566 ]. MedusaLocker ransomware uses a batch file to execute PowerShell script invoke-ReflectivePEInjection [ T1059.001 ]. This script propagates MedusaLocker throughout the network by editing the EnableLinkedConnections value within the infected machine’s registry, which then allows the infected machine to detect attached hosts and networks via Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and to detect shared storage via Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. MedusaLocker then: Restarts the LanmanWorkstation service, which allows registry edits to take effect. Kills the processes of well-known security, accounting, and forensic software. Restarts the machine in safe mode to avoid detection by security software [ T1562.009 ]. Encrypts victim files with the AES-256 encryption algorithm; the resulting key is then encrypted with an RSA-2048 public key [ T1486 ]. Runs every 60 seconds, encrypting all files except those critical to the functionality of the victim’s machine and those that have the designated encrypted file extension. Establishes persistence by copying an executable ( svhost.exe or svhostt.exe ) to the %APPDATA%\Roaming directory and scheduling a task to run the ransomware every 15 minutes. Attempts to prevent standard recovery techniques by deleting local backups, disabling startup recovery options, and deleting shadow copies [ T1490 ]. MedusaLocker actors place a ransom note into every folder containing a file with the victim's encrypted data. The note outlines how to communicate with the MedusaLocker actors, typically providing victims one or more email address at which the actors can be reached. The size of MedusaLocker ransom demands appears to vary depending on the victim’s financial status as perceived by the actors.

Table 1: MedusaLocker Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise Initial Access Technique Title ID Use External Remote Services T1133 MedusaLocker actors gained access to victim devices through vulnerable RDP configurations. Phishing T1566 MedusaLocker actors used phishing and spearphishing to obtain access to victims' networks. Execution Technique Title ID Use Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell T1059.001 MedusaLocker actors may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. Defense Evasion Technique Title ID Use Impair Defenses: Safe Mode Boot T1562.009 MedusaLocker actors may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses. Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services. Impact Technique Title ID Use Data Encrypted for Impact T1486 MedusaLocker actors encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. Inhibit System Recovery T1490 MedusaLocker actors may deny access to operating systems containing features that can help fix corrupted systems, such as backup catalog, volume shadow copies, and automatic repair. Mitigations Implement a recovery plan that maintains and retains multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud). Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure limited interruption to the organization. Regularly back up data and password protect backup copies stored offline. Ensure copies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides. Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all hosts. Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as possible. Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or unrecognized accounts. Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege. Disable unused ports. Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization. Disable hyperlinks in received emails. Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA). Use National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies: Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length. Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers. Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials. Avoid reusing passwords. Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts. Disable password “hints”. Refrain from requiring password changes unless there is evidence of password compromise. Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords and no longer require regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher. Require administrator credentials to install software. Only use secure networks; avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a virtual private network (VPN) to establish secure remote connections. Focus on cybersecurity awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, such as ransomware and phishing scams.
