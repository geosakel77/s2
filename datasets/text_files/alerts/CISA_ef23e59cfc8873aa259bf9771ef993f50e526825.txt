More Alerts Alert (TA04-356A) Exploitation of phpBB highlight parameter vulnerability Original release date: December 21, 2004  | Last revised : December 22, 2004 Systems Affected phpBB versions 2.0.10 and prior Overview The software phpBB contains an input validation problem in how it processes a parameter contained in URLs.
An intruder can deface a phpBB website, execute arbitrary commands, or gain administrative privileges on a 
compromised bulletin board. Description phpBB is an open-source bulletin board application. It improperly performs an urldecode() on the "highlight" parameter 
supplied to viewtopic.php. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a 
vulnerable server. According to reports, this vulnerability is being actively exploited by the Santy.A worm. 
The worm appears to propogate by searching for the keyword "viewtopic.php" in order 
to find vulnerable sites. The worm writes itself to a file named "m1ho2of" on the compromised system. It then overwrites files 
ending with .htm, .php, .asp. shtm, .jsp, and .phtm replacing them with HTML content that defaces the web page. 
The worm then tries to use PERL to execute itself on the compromised system
and propogate further. US-CERT is tracking this issue as: VU#497400 - 
phpBB viewtopic.php fails to properly sanitize input passed to the "highlight" parameter Impact A remote attacker may be able to deface a phpBB website and execute arbitrary commands on a compromised bulletin board. Solution Upgrade phpBB Upgrade to phpBB version 2.0.11 to prevent exploitation. Appendix A.
