             Alert Regarding Vulnerability in ISC BIND 9

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2019/at190043.html


I. Overview
ISC BIND 9 contains a vulnerability regarding TCP-pipelining. When this
vulnerability is exploited, a remote attacker may cause named to become
temporarily unresponsive or potentially degrade service quality by
consuming excessive system resource.
ISC has rated the severity of the vulnerability CVE-2019-6477 as
"Medium". For more information on the vulnerability, please refer to
the information provided by ISC.

    Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (ISC)
    CVE-2019-6477: TCP-pipelined queries can bypass tcp-clients limit
    https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2019-6477

If you are operating an affected version of ISC BIND 9, please consider
updating to a version that addresses this vulnerability by referring to
the information in "III. Solution".


II. Affected Systems
According to ISC, the following versions are affected by this
vulnerability.

  - BIND 9.14.x versions from 9.14.1 to 9.14.7
  - BIND 9.12.x versions from 9.12.4-P1 to 9.12.4-P2
  - BIND 9.11.x versions from 9.11.6-P1 to 9.11.12
  - BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions from 9.11.5-S6 to 9.11.12-S1

If you are using BIND provided by a distributor, please refer to the
information provided by that distributor. Also, versions prior to
BIND 9.11.0, which are no longer supported, have not been evaluated
for this vulnerability according to ISC.


III. Solution
ISC has released versions of ISC BIND 9 that address this
vulnerability. Distributors are likely to provide their own versions
that address the vulnerability. Consider updating to an updated
version after thorough testing.

  - BIND 9 version 9.11.13
  - BIND 9 version 9.14.8
  - BIND Supported Preview Edition version 9.11.13-S1

Also, the vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling server TCP-pipelining
by configuring as follows. However, the server restart is necessary because
neither a 'reload' nor a 'reconfig' operation will properly reset currently
pipelining TCP clients.
