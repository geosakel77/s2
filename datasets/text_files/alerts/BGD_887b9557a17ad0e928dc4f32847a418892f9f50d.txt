      Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player could allow an
      unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the
      system of a targeted user. An attacker could exploit these
      vulnerabilities by sending a user a link or email attachment
      containing a malicious ARF (Advanced Recording Format) or WRF
      (Webex Recording Format) file via a link or an email attachment
      and persuading the user to open the file with the affected
      software. Impact: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities
      could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user’s
      system. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an
      attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete
      data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose
      accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system
      could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative
      user rights. System Affected: * Cisco Webex — all Webex Network Recording Player and Webex
      Player releases earlier than Release WBS 39.5.17 or WBS 39.11.0 * Cisco Webex Meetings Online — all Webex Network Recording Player
      and Webex Player releases earlier than Release 1.3.49 * Cisco Webex Meetings Server — all Webex Network Recording Player
      releases earlier than Release 3.0MR3SecurityPatch1 and
      4.0MR2SecurityPatch2 Mitigation: The following actions are recommended: * Install the update provided by Cisco immediately after
      appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without
      administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful
      attack. * Remind users not to visit websites or follow links provided by
      unknown or untrusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by
      hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from
      un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and
      services.
