Overview Oracle has released patch to address numerous vulnerabilities in different Oracle products. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service. Description Oracle has released the Critical Patch Update - October 2006 . According to Oracle, this CPU contains: 22 new security fixes for the Oracle Database 6 new security fixes for Oracle HTTP Server 35 new security fixes for Oracle Application Express 14 new security fixes for the Oracle Application Server 13 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite 8 new security fixes for Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools and Enterprise Portal Solutions 1 new security fix for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 1 new security fix for Oracle Pharmaceutical Applications Many Oracle products include or share code with other vulnerable Oracle products and components.  Therefore, one vulnerability may affect multiple Oracle products and components.  For example, the October 2006 CPU does not contain any fixes specifically for Oracle Collaboration Suite.  However, Oracle Collaboration Suite is affected by vulnerabilities in Oracle Database and Oracle Application Server, so sites running Oracle Collaboration suite should install fixes for Oracle Database and Oracle Application Server.  Refer to the October 2006 CPU for details regarding which vulnerabilities affect specific Oracle products and components. For a list of publicly known vulnerabilities addressed in the October 2006 CPU, refer to the Map of Public Vulnerability to Advisory/Alert .  The October 2006 CPU does not associate Vuln# identifiers (e.g., DB01) with other available information, even in the Map of Public Vulnerability to Advisory/Alert document. As more details about vulnerabilities and remediation strategies become available, we will update the individual vulnerability notes . Impact The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include remote execution of arbitrary code or commands, sensitive information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to gain access to sensitive information or take complete control of the host system. Solution Apply patches from Oracle Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Critical Patch Update - October 2006 . Note that this Critical Patch Update only lists newly corrected vulnerabilities. As noted in the update, some patches are cumulative, others are not: The Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control, Oracle Collaboration Suite, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, JD Edwards OneWorld Tools, PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal Applications and PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools patches in the Updates are cumulative; each Critical Patch Update contains the fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates. Oracle E-Business Suite and Applications patches are not cumulative, so E-Business Suite and Applications customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous fixes they want to apply. The October 2006 CPU lists 35 vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Application Express. These vulnerabilities are addressed in Oracle Application Express version 2.2.1 . Oracle Application Express users are encouraged to upgrade to version 2.2.1 as soon as possible. Vulnerabilities described in the October 2006 CPU may affect Oracle Database 10 g Express Edition (XE) . According to Oracle, Oracle Database XE is based on the Oracle Database 10 g Release 2 code. Patches for some platforms and components were not available when the Critical Patch Update was published on October 17, 2006. Please see MetaLink Note 391563.1 (login required) for more information about patch availability. Known issues with Oracle patches are documented in the pre-installation notes and patch readme files. Please consult these documents and test before making changes to production systems.
