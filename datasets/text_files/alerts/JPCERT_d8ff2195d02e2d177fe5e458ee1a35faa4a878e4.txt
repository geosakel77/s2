                  Alert regarding the abuse of SIP servers

           https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2013/at130036.html


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has received an incident report related to the abuse of a
SIP server. Around the same time, a separate report from another
reporter was received stating that a compromised server contained an
attack tool to abuse SIP servers. From these reports, it can be
assumed that the attacker used a compromised server to search for SIP
servers and placed an attack tool to obtain SIP accounts (*1).  For
more details on the behavior of the attack tool, please refer to
"II. Attack Scenario"

The Telecommunications Carriers Association (TCA) has issued the
following alert, which leads to the assumption that this attack led to
the unauthorized use of IP Phone services through the abuse of stolen
SIP accounts.

   Unauthorized third-party use of IP phones through impersonation (Japanese only)
   http://www.tca.or.jp/press_release/2013/0806_583.html

Also based on data collected by the internet traffic monitoring system
(TSUBAME *2) run by JPCERT/CC, an increase in packets searching for
SIP servers has been observed. Regarding these observations, we believe
that this may continue, therefore to prevent further abuse of SIP servers, 
this alert is being published.

  *1 Account information to use services provided by the SIP server
  *2 The name of the Asia / Pacific internet traffic monitoring system 
     run by JPCERT/CC


II. Attack Scenario

  The attacker is most likely conducting an attack such as the
following, based on information from the attack tool and other
information provided to JPCERT/CC.

  1. The attacker modifies a publicly available SIP vulnerability scanning tool
     into a program where information can be collected by the attacker.
  2. The attacker gains access to servers that use weak passwords or have 
     vulnerabilities not addressed and runs the tool from step 1.
  3. The server with the attack tool running, will look for SIP servers that
     can be searched for on the internet.
  4. When the attack server locates a SIP server, it will conduct a 130 
     thousand line dictionary attack to obtain the SIP account.
  5. When the SIP account is obtained, the attack tool will send the 
     information to an external server via email.


III. Observations from the internet traffic monitoring system (TSUBAME)

  The packets used for the search in step 3 of "II. Attack Scenario"
have been observed since July, 2010 by TSUBAME system sensors (Figure 1). 
Similar packets have been observed by other sensors placed in the
Asia / Pacific region.

IV. Solution

  Users that are using SIP servers or SIP enabled devices should set strong
passwords to prevent the SIP account being stolen for unauthorized use.

  - Countermeasures for the SIP account
    - Do not use the default password
    - Do not use the same string for the ID and password
    - Do not use a blank or simple string for the password
      * The dictionary file in the attack tool contains numbers within 
        10 digits, English words from the dictionary and English words
        with some characters replaced with numbers or symbols. This file
        is used to determine the ID and password
  - Unless it is necessary, do not allow direct access from the internet to
    SIP servers and SIP enabled devices
    - Using functions provided by a router or firewall, block external packets
      directed to SIP servers and SIP enabled devices
    - If connection from the internet is required, use a VPN connection
  - Periodically check the logs from the SIP server and SIP enabled devices for
    unauthorized outgoing transmissions

The attack tool also collects the software information (version
number, etc.)  of the SIP server, so if using a SIP server that
contains vulnerabilities, it may become the subject of a separate
attack leveraging such vulnerabilities. Therefore, please apply the
latest security update program to SIP servers and SIP enabled devices.
