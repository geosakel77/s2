Google Chrome is a web browser used to access the Internet. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows: * A Use after free exists in Blink component. (CVE-2021-30606) * A Use after free exists in Permissions component. (CVE-2021-30607) * A Use after free exists in Web Share component. (CVE-2021-30608) * A Use after free exists in Sign-In component. (CVE-2021-30609) * A Use after free exists in Extensions API component. (CVE-2021-30610) * A Use after free exists in WebRTC component. (CVE-2021-30611, CVE-2021-30612) * A Use after free exists in Base internal component. (CVE-2021-30613) * A Heap buffer overflow in TabStrip component. (CVE-2021-30614) * A Cross-origin data leak in Navigation component. (CVE-2021-30615) * A Use after free exists in Media component. (CVE-2021-30616) * A Policy bypass exists in Blink component. (CVE-2021-30617) * An Inappropriate implementation exists in DevTools component. (CVE-2021-30618) * A UI Spoofing exists in Autofill component.

(CVE-2021-30622) * A Use after free exists in Bookmark component. (CVE-2021-30623) * A Use after free exists in Autofill component. (CVE-2021-30624) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Google Chrome versions prior to 93.0.4577.63 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply the stable channel update provided by Google to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
