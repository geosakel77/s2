Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apple iOS that could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * A memory corruption issue in the ASN.1 decoder may lead to arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30737) * A memory corruption issue in WebKit may lead to arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30761) * A use after free issue in WebKit may lead to arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30762) Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * iOS versions prior to 12.5.4 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Apple to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a nonprivileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to download, accept or execute files from untrusted and unknown sources. * Remind users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by untrusted or unknown sources. * Evaluate read, write, and execute permissions on all newly installed software. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
