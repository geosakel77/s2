Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Photoshop, Digital Editions, Bridge and RoboHelp, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Adobe Photoshop * Buffer Overflow, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28548, CVE-2021-28549) Adobe Digital Editions * Privilege Escalation, which could allow for arbitrary file system write. (CVE-2021-21100) Adobe Bridge * Out-of-bounds read, which could allow for information disclosure. (CVE-2021-21091) * Improper Authorization, which could allow for privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-21096) * Memory Corruption, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21093, CVE-2021-21092) * Out-of-bounds write, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21094, CVE-2021-21095) Adobe RoboHelp * Uncontrolled search path element, which could allow for privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-21070) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Adobe Photoshop 2020 versions 21.2.6 and earlier * Adobe Photoshop 2021 versions 22.3 and earlier * Adobe Digital Editions versions 4.5.11.187245 and earlier * Adobe Bridge versions 10.1.1 and earlier * Adobe Bridge versions 11.0.1 and earlier * Adobe RoboHelp versions RH2020.0.3 and earlier RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
