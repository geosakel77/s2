             Alert regarding DNS cache poisoning attack

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2014/at140016.html


I. Overview

  Cache DNS servers that do not randomize the UDP source port
(hereinafter "source port randomization") contain known vulnerability
which may allow attackers to perform cache poisoning attack. A remote
attacker may leverage this vulnerability and poison a cache DNS
server with forged DNS information.

  According to the information provided by Japan Registry Services
Co., Ltd. (hereinafter "JPRS"), they have been observing DNS queries
from DNS servers that do not implement source port randomization to
DNS servers operated by JPRS. Additionally, they are informed by some
Internet Service Providers that the access targeting this
vulnerability has been increasingly observed.

  It is estimated that such attacks may keep increasing henceforth,
and therefore administrators are recommended to take measures such as
applying a patch addressing this vulnerability and modifying the
configuration.


II. Products Affected

  This vulnerability may affect multiple DNS server software. For more
information, please refer to the advisory issued by the vendors on the
following websites:

    JVNVU#800113
    Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning (Japanese)
    https://jvn.jp/cert/JVNVU800113/index.html

    Vulnerability Note VU#800113
    Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning
    https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

  Note that the software products which are not mentioned in the
websites above may also be affected. For other software products used
in your system, please contact the vendors.


III. Solution

  For administrators operating DNS server software affected by this
vulnerability, it is recommended to take measures such as applying
a patch which addresses this vulnerability and modifying the
configuration.

  Please be aware of the following 3 notes upon applying the
solutions:

  Note 1: 'named.conf' configuration

  When BIND is used, named.conf may have been configured to specify a
  static DNS query source port as follows:

    query-source    port 53;
    query-source-v6 port 53;

  In this case, even after updating the version, the source port
  randomization will not take effect as long as you do not modify the
  configuration.


  Note 2: Port translation on network devices

  Due to the function of Network Address Translation (NAT) of network
  devices such as firewalls and routers, the source port randomization
  implemented by DNS server may not work properly. For more details on
  how to modify the configuration and update the firmware, please
  refer to the information provided by the vendors.


  Note 3: Firewall configuration

  Once the solution is applied, source ports for queries from a DNS
  server become randomized. This may cause a firewall to restrict
  communication from the DNS server. Administrators are recommended to
  check the firewall settings before modifying the configuration of the
  DNS server.
