Solid Edge is used for designing and viewing 2D and 3D models. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Siemens’ Solid Edge, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the system process. Exploits can be triggered by an unsuspecting user opening a malicious file with the vulnerable software. Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows: * An out-of-bounds write error when parsing ‘PAR’ files due to a failure to properly validate user input (CVE-2020-28381, CVE-2020-28382, CVE-2020-28383) * A stack-based buffer-overflow when parsing ‘PAR’ files (CVE-2020-28384 and CVE-2020-26989) * An out-of-bounds write error when parsing ‘DFT’ files (CVE-2020-28386) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Solid Edge versions prior to 2021MP2 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Siemens immediately after appropriate testing. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services; run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights REFERENCES: https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-979834.pdf https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-21-012-04 Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
