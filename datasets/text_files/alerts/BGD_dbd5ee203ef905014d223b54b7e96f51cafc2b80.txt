Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * Multiple vulnerabilities in Framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to cause a permanent denial of service. (CVE-2021-0595, CVE-2021-0683, CVE-2021-0684, CVE-2021-0685, CVE-2021-0687, CVE-2021-0688) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Media Framework that could enable a local malicious application to bypass operating system protections that isolate application data from other applications. (CVE-2021-0689, CVE-2021-0690) * Multiple vulnerabilities in System that could enable a local attacker using a specially crafted transmission to gain access to additional permissions. (CVE-2021-0428, CVE-2021-0598, CVE-2021-0644, CVE-2021-0682, CVE-2021-0691, CVE-2021-0692, CVE-2021-0693) * A vulnerability in Kernel components could enable a local malicious application to bypass operating system protections that isolate application data from other applications. (CVE-2021-0695) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in MediaTek Components. (CVE-2021-0680, CVE-2021-0681) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Unisoc Components. (CVE-2021-0635, CVE-2021-0636) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm components. (CVE-2021-1941, CVE-2021-1948, CVE-2021-1974, CVE-2021-30290, CVE-2021-30294) * Multiple critical and high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm closed-source components (CVE-2021-1886, CVE-2021-1888, CVE-2021-1889, CVE-2021-1890, CVE-2021-1933, CVE-2021-1946, CVE-2021-1909, CVE-2021-1923, CVE-2021-1934, CVE-2021-1935, CVE-2021-1952, CVE-2021-1971, CVE-2021-30295) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Android OS builds utilizing Security Patch Levels issued prior to September 5, 2021. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates by Google Android or mobile carriers to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. * Remind users to only download applications from trusted vendors in the Play Store. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources.
