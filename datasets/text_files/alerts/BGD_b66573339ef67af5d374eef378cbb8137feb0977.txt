Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Adobe Premiere Rush * Out-of-bounds Read, which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2022-23204) Adobe Illustrator * Out-of-bounds Write which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-23186) * NULL Pointer Dereference which could allow for Application denial-of-service (CVE-2022-23189, CVE-2022-23198, CVE-2022-23199) * Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer which could allow for a Memory leak (CVE-2022-23190, CVE-2022-23191, CVE-2022-23192, CVE-2022-23193, CVE-2022-23194, CVE-2022-23195) * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for a Memory leak (CVE-2022-23196, CVE-2022-23197) * Buffer Overflow which could allow for Arbitrary code execution (CVE-2022-23188) Adobe Photoshop * Buffer Overflow which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-23203) Adobe After Effects * Out-of-bounds Write which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-23200) Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop * Uncontrolled Search Path Element which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-23202) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Adobe Premiere Rush 2.0  and earlier versions for Windows. * Illustrator 2022 26.0.2 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Illustrator 2021 25.4.3 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Photoshop 2021 22.5.4 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Photoshop 2022 23.1 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Adobe After Effects 22.1.1 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Adobe After Effects 18.4.3 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Creative Cloud Desktop Application (Installer) 2.7.0.13 and earlier versions for Windows. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
