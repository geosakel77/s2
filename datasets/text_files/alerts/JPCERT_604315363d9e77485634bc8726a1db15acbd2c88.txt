                 Vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 (S2-032)

          https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2016/at160020.html


I. Overview

 Apache Struts 2 provided by the Apache Software Foundation contains a
vulnerability (S2-032/CVE-2016-3081). When Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI)
is enabled, a remote attacker sending a specially crafted HTTP request
may execute arbitrary code on the server that runs an application using
Apache Struts 2 (Struts application). For more details on the vulnerability,
please refer to the information provided by the Apache Software Foundation.

  Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for this vulnerability has been already made
public, and JPCERT/CC's test of this code confimed that arbitrary code
was executed with the execution privilege of the application server
which runs the Struts application. In Apache Struts versions 2.3.15.2 and
later, DMI has been disabled by default. However, if DMI is enabled,
it is recommended to consider applying a countermeasure as soon as possible.
The National Police Agency has observed activity attempting to leverage
this Apache Struts 2 vulnerability.

  Apache Software Foundation has provided versions of the software that
address the vulnerability. For those using an affected version of the
software and those with DMI enabled, it is strongly recommended to quickly
resolve the issue based on information provided in "V. Solution" or
"VI. Workarounds".


II. A Possible Attack Scenario

  Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a Struts application with
DMI enabled may result in arbitrary code execution on the server which
runs the Struts application.


III. Affected Systems

  The following versions are affected by this vulnerability:

  - Apache Struts versions 2.3.20 through 2.3.28
    (except for 2.3.20.3 and 2.3.24.3)

  Products that contain Apache Struts 2 are also affected by this
vulnerability. 


IV. Test Results from JPCERT/CC

  JPCERT/CC tested the PoC code that leverages this vulnerability.

  [Test content]
  - Using the proof-of-concept code, a sample application that uses 
    Apache Struts 2 was deployed in Apache Tomcat. We examined if arbitrary
    OS command is executed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.

  [Test Environment]
  - Application Server
    - CentOS 7.2.1511
    - Apache Tomcat 7.0.57
    - Java 1.8.0_71
    - Sample application that uses Apache Struts 2

  [Test Results] 
  - We observed that arbitrary code execution is possible on a server 
    that uses the affected versions of Apache Struts 2.
  - We observed that arbitrary code is not executed on a server that
    uses the versions of Apache Struts 2 where the vulnerability has 
    been addressed.
  - We observed that arbitrary code is not executed on servers with
    Apache Struts 2 with disabled DMI. DMI is disabled by default in
    Apache Struts versions 2.3.15.2 and later.

                             |  enable DMI  | disable DMI  |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.28.1  | not affected |              |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.28    |   affected   | not affected |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.24.3  | not affected |              |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.24.1  |   affected   | not affected |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.24    |   affected   | not affected |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.20.3  | not affected |              |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.20.1  |   affected   | not affected |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.20    |   affected   | not affected |


V. Solution

 Apache Software Foundation has released a version addressing this
vulnerability. It is recommended to update to this latest version
after thorough testing. If an update cannot be applied, please consider
applying workarounds based on the information provided in "VI. Workarounds"
to mitigate the impacts of the vulnerability.
  
  -  Apache Struts 2.3.20.3
  -  Apache Struts 2.3.24.3
  -  Apache Struts 2.3.28.1


VI. Workarounds

  Please consider the following workarounds to mitigate the impacts of the
vulnerability. 

  (1) If Direct Method Invocation (DMI) is enabled, disable it.
       For more details, please refer to the following information.

      Apache Struts 2 Documentation
      Dynamic Method Invocation
      https://struts.apache.org/docs/action-configuration.html#ActionConfiguration-DynamicMethodInvocation

  (2) Implement a customized ActionMapper based on the source code of a
      version of Apache Struts 2 that has the vulnerability addressed.
      For more details, please refer to the following information.

      Apache Struts 2 Documentation
