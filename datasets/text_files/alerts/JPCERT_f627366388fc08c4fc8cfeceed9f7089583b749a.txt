            Alert Regarding Access Controls in memcached

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2018/at180009.html


I. Overview
JPCERT/CC has been observing an increase in access to port 11211/udp
since February 21, 2018 through information provided by external
organizations as well as data from JPCERT/CC's packet Internet
monitoring system (TSUBAME). Observation through TSUBAME on the scan
packets targeting this port suggests that these scan packets may be
targeting memcached. Depending on the settings, memcached may be
unintentionally exposed to the Internet and may be responding to
scans. In these cases, it may be exploited to attack others or to
access information that memcached holds. JPCERT/CC has received
reports on DDoS attacks that exploited memcached.

Scan observations from TSUBAME for port 11211/udp (February 1, 2018 - February 27, 2018)

Users of memcached are recommended to apply appropriate access
controls so that the servers are not exploited for attacks.

** Update: February 28, 2018 Update **********************************
On February 27, 2018 (local time), Danga Interactive released an
updated version 1.5.6 of memcached. According to the release note,
port 11211/udp is disabled by default in this update. Please check
the latest information provided by Danga Interactive.

**********************************************************************


II. Affected Products
Based on the characteristics of the scan packets observed in TSUBAME,
the following products are possibly affected:

  - memcached

When memcached version 1.2.7 or later is used with default settings,
ports 11211/tcp and 11211/udp may be unintentionally exposed.


III. Solution
To prevent unwanted access to information held by memcahed or being
exploited for use in other attacks, it is strongly recommended to
apply appropriate access controls.

  - Restrict IP addresses and ports used for access
    Open access to memcached only to necessary IP addresses or restrict
    the ports that are used

** Update: February 28, 2018 Update **********************************
On updated version 1.5.6 of memcached, port 11211/udp is disabled by
default. Please consider updating memcached as well as restricting
ports used for access.
**********************************************************************

Please note that software other than memcached can be exploited for
DDoS attacks. We recommend checking the settings for ntpd, DNS and
other software used in the server and apply appropriate access
restrictions.
