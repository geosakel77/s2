Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code
execution within the context of a privileged process. Details of these
vulnerabilities are as follows:

* An information disclosure vulnerability in Android runtime.
(CVE-2017-13309)
* Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Framework.
(CVE-2017-13310, CVE-2017-13311)
* Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities in Kernel components.
(CVE-2017-16643, CVE-2017-5754)
* An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Media framework.
(CVE-2017-13312)
* A denial of service vulnerability in Media framework. (CVE-2017-13313)
* An information disclosure vulnerability in NVIDIA components.
(CVE-2017-5715)
* Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in NVIDIA components.
(CVE-2017-6289, CVE-2017-6293)
* Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Qualcomm
components. (CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-18154, CVE-2018-3562,
CVE-2018-3565, CVE-2018-3578, CVE-2018-5840, CVE-2018-5841,
CVE-2018-5845, CVE-2018-5846, CVE-2018-5850)
* An arbitrary code vulnerability in Qualcomm components. (CVE-2018-3580)
* Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in System.
(CVE-2017-13314, CVE-2017-13315) Impact : Successful exploitation of the most severe of these
vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context
of a privileged process. These vulnerabilities could be exploited
through multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when
processing media files. Depending on the privileges associated with the
application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or
delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this
application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system,
exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less
impact than if it was configured with administrative rights.

System Affected:
* Android OS builds utilizing Security Patch Levels issued prior to May
5, 2018. Mitigation :
The following actions are recommended:
* Apply appropriate updates by Google Android or mobile carriers to
vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing, when they
become available.
* Remind users to only download applications from trusted vendors in the
Play Store.
* Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided
by unknown or un-trusted sources.
* Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links
contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources.
