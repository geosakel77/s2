vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from untrusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
