Alert Regarding Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2021/at210050.html


I. Overview
** Update: January 4, 2022 *****************************************
This alert continues to be updated depending on future situation.
Please pay close attention to the related information and check the
future update of this alert.

The following updates have been made. For details, please refer to
"III. Solution".

 - Apache Log4j versions 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later), 2.12.4 (for Java 7) and 2.3.2 (for Java 6) have been released.
*********************************************************************

Apache Log4j, a Java-based open-source logging library, contains an
arbitrary code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). A remote
attacker may execute arbitrary code on a server running Apache Log4j
by sending specially crafted data that exploits this vulnerability.

    Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities
    Fixed in Log4j 2.15.0
    https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html

Apache Log4j has a function called Lookup, which replaces some strings
as variables from the strings recorded as logs. Among them, when the
JNDI Lookup function is exploited, a remote attacker may send a
specially crafted character string and Log4j records it as a log,
then Log4j may read and execute the java class from the external
server or internal path specified by Lookup, which may result in
arbitrary code execution.

On December 11, 2021, JPCERT/CC confirmed that Proof-of-Concept code
that exploit the vulnerability has been made public, and that
communications attempting to exploit this vulnerability have been made
in Japan. If you are using Apache Log4j, it is recommended to consider
implementing version upgrades and applying workarounds.

In addition, security updates are released for applications and software
that use Apache Log4j. Please pay close attention to the relevant
information and consider implementing necessary measures. 


II. Affected Versions
The following versions are affected by the vulnerability.

  - Apache Log4j-core version 2.x prior to 2.15.0

In addition, JPCERT/CC has confirmed the information that the version
of Apache Log4j 1.x that has already reached the End of Life does not
include the Lookup function, and even if JMS Appender is enabled, the
class information is not deserialized, therefore not affected by the
vulnerability.

Information about affected versions and conditions may change or be
updated, and information may be released by the developers of
applications and software that use Apache Log4j. For the latest
information, please check the related information provided by each
developers or organization. 

** Update: December 13, 2021 Update *********************************
Regarding the version of Apache Log4j 1.x, it is pointed out that
it may be possible to exploit the vulnerability if an attacker can
alter the Log4j configuration file, which requires unauthorized
access to the system in advance in order to carry out the attack.

*********************************************************************


III. Solution
The Apache Software Foundation has released the updates containing
fixes for the vulnerability. Please consider applying the measures
promptly. In the following versions and later, the Lookup feature is
disabled by default.

  - Apache Log4j 2.15.0

It is recommended to pay close attention to the related information
about the application and software in place, and if they are found
to be affected by this vulnerability, take immediate action such as
updating.

In addition to implementing countermeasures, since communication that
attempts to exploit this vulnerability has already been confirmed, it
is recommended to check the existence of suspicious files and processes,
communication logs, etc., to confirm the evidence of attacks.

** Update: December 15, 2021 Update *********************************
The Apache Software Foundation has released versions 2.16.0 (for Java
8 and later version) and 2.12.2 (for Java 7) of Apache Log4j.

Since It was discovered that in certain non-default configurations
Apache Log4j2 is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) when malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern is sent, access to JNDI has been
disabled by default. This issue was assigned CVE-2021-45046.

    Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities
    Fixed in Log4j 2.12.2 (Java 7) and Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8)
    https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#log4j-2.16.0

In addition of countermeasures for the arbitrary code execution
vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), it is recommended updating to the
version 2.16.0 or 2.12.2 to address risks such as the denial of
service attack vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046).
*********************************************************************

** Update: December 20, 2021 Update *********************************
Regarding the impacts of CVE-2021-45046, information has been
released that it is possible to execute arbitrary code in some
environments.
*********************************************************************

** Update: December 20, 2021 Update *********************************
On December 18, 2021 (Local Time), The Apache Software Foundation
released version 2.17.0 of Apache Log4j (for Java 8 and later).

A denial of service attack vulnerability (CVE-2021-45105) exists in
some environments with non-default configuration due to uncontrolled
recursion from self-referential lookups.

*********************************************************************


IV. Workarounds
The Apache Software Foundation has released information about
workarounds depending on the versions of Log4j.

** Update: December 15, 2021 Update *********************************
The Apache Software Foundation has revealed that some workarounds
have been incomplete to avoid attacks using specific techniques.
It is recommended to remove JndiLookup.class from the classpath as
an effective workaround.

    Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities
    Fixed in Log4j 2.12.2 and Log4j 2.16.0
    https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html
*********************************************************************

  Log4j version 2.10 and later
  - Apply one of the following: 
  (1) Setting system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups to "true"
  (2) Set the environment variable "LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS" to "true"

  Log4j version prior to 2.10
  - Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath

Also, in order to mitigate the effects of attacks that exploit this
vulnerability, please consider reviewing and strengthening access
control as much as possible to limit the connection from the system to
the outside.
