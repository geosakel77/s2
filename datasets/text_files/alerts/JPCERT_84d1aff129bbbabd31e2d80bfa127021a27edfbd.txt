  JPCERT-AT-2008-0014
  Cache-Poisoning Vulnerability In Multiple DNS Servers
  http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2008/at080014.txt

********************************************************************


I. Overview

  The DNS protocol and multiple DNS servers contain a vulnerability
that allows cache-poisoning attacks. A remote attacker could use this
vulnerability and pollute a DNS cache server with forged DNS 
information.

  Details of this vulnerability will be announced by an overseas 
security researcher in August 2008.

*** Update: Added on July 23, 2008 ***********************************

  On July 22, 2008, information of attack techniques against this 
vulnerability was accidentally made public earlier than originally
scheduled. Because of this, attacks targeting this vulnerability are
more likely to occur within several days. Administrators should
immediately apply corrected software provided by the vendors.

**********************************************************************

II. Products Affected

  This vulnerability affects multiple DNS servers.

  Major products affected are as follows:
  - ISC BIND (including BIND 8) 
  - Microsoft DNS servers
  - Multiple Cisco products
  - Multiple Juniper products (including Netscreen products)

  For more information, refer to the advisories issued by the vendors.

  Note that other products may also be affected. When using a DNS
server not mentioned above, contact its vendor.


III. Solution

  Update the products to the corrected software provided by the 
vendors.

*** Update: Added on July 11, 2008 ***********************************

  When BIND is used in distributions such as Debian GNU/Linux and
Fedora, named.conf may have been configured as follows, which fixes
the source port of DNS queries:

    query-source    port 53;
    query-source-v6 port 53;

  In this case, the countermeasure to the cache-poisoning
vulnerability is not sufficient until this configuration is changed
after updating BIND. For information on how to change the
configuration, refer to the vendors' websites.

  Once the configuration is changed, source ports for queries from a
DNS server become randomized. This could cause a firewall to restrict
communication from the DNS server. Administrators are recommended to
check the firewall settings before changing the configuration.
