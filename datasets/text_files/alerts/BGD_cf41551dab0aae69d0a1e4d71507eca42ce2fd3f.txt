A Content Security Policy (CSP) is not properly enforced on chrome-privileged documents, which are used by extensions in Mozilla FireFox. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user running a vulnerable version of the application to follow a specially crafted link designed to trigger this issue. Impact : Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. System Affected : Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 58.0.1 Mitigation : The following actions are recommended: Apply appropriate updates provided by Mozilla to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
