Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * Multiple vulnerabilities in Framework that could enable a local attacker to gain access to additional permissions with no user interaction required. (CVE-2021-0955, CVE-2021-0970, CVE-0704, CVE-2021-0971) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Media Framework that could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed (CVE-2021-0967, CVE-2021-0964) * A vulnerability in Media Framework that could lead to remote code execution (CVE-2021-0967) * Multiple vulnerabilities in System could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process (CVE-2021-0968, CVE-2021-0956, CVE-2021-0453, CVE-2021-0654, CVE-2021-0963, CVE-2021-0965, CVE-2021-0952, CVE-2021-0966, CVE-2021-0958, CVE-2021-0969) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Project Mainline components. (CVE-2021-0964, CVE-2021-0967, CVE-2021-0971) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Kernel components that could lead to an integer overflow, an Out-of Bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user (CVE-2021-33909, CVE-2021-38204, CVE-2021-0961) * Multiple vulnerabilities in MediaTek components. (CVE-2021-0675, CVE-2021-0904) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm components. (CVE-2021-30262, CVE-2021-30335, CVE-2021-30337) * Multiple high and critical severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm closed-source components. (CVE-2021-30275, CVE-2021-30276, CVE-2021-30351, CVE-2020-11263, CVE-2021-1894, CVE-2021-1918, CVE-2021-30267, CVE-2021-30268, CVE-2021-30269, CVE-2021-30270, CVE-2021-30271, CVE-2021-30272, CVE-2021-30273, CVE-2021-30274, CVE-2021-30278, CVE-2021-30279, CVE-2021-30282, CVE-2021-30283, CVE-2021-30289, CVE-2021-30293, CVE-2021-30303, CVE-2021-30336) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Android OS builds utilizing Security Patch Levels issued prior to December 6, 2021. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates by Google Android or mobile carriers to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. * Remind users to only download applications from trusted vendors in the Play Store. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources.
