                 Vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 (S2-037)

          https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2016/at160027.html


I. Overview

 Apache Struts 2 provided by the Apache Software Foundation contains a
vulnerability (S2-037/CVE-2016-4438). When using REST Plugin*1, a remote 
attacker sending a specially crafted HTTP request leveraging the vulnerability
may execute arbitrary code on the server that runs an application using
Apache Struts 2 (Struts application). 
  For more details on the vulnerability, please refer to the information 
provided by the Apache Software Foundation.

   *1 A plugin for implementation of REST services in Struts application
   REST Plugin
   https://struts.apache.org/docs/rest-plugin.html

  Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for this vulnerability has been already 
made public, and JPCERT/CC's test of this code confimed that arbitrary 
code was executed with the execution privilege of the application server
which runs the Struts application. 

  Apache Software Foundation has provided versions of the software that
address the vulnerability. For those using an affected version of the
software, it is strongly recommended to quickly resolve the issue based 
on information provided in "V. Solution".


II. A Possible Attack Scenario

  Sending a specially crafted HTTP request leveraging the vulnerability 
to a Struts application with REST Plugin may result in arbitrary code 
execution on the server which runs the Struts application.


III. Affected Systems

  The following versions are affected by this vulnerability:

  - Apache Struts versions 2.3.20 through 2.3.28.1


IV. Test Results from JPCERT/CC

  JPCERT/CC tested the PoC code that leverages this vulnerability.

  [Test content]
  - Deploy a sample application that uses Apache Struts 2 on 
    Apache Tomcat. We examined if arbitrary code is executed by 
    sending a specially crafted HTTP request using the proof-of-concept
    code.

  [Test Environment]
  - Application Server
    - CentOS 6.6
    - Apache Tomcat 8.0.30
    - Java 1.8.0_91
    - Sample application that uses Apache Struts 2

  [Test Results] 
   - Apache Struts 2.3.28.1 | affected     |
   - Apache Struts 2.3.29   | not affected |


V. Solution

 Apache Software Foundation has released a version addressing this
vulnerability. It is recommended to update to this latest version
after thorough testing.
  
  -  Apache Struts 2.3.29
