The software can be licensed and integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked library. Treck IP software contains multiple vulnerabilities, most of which are caused by memory management bugs. For more details on the vulnerabilities introduced by these bugs, see Treck’s Vulnerability Response Information and JSOF’s Ripple20 advisory. Historically-related KASAGO TCP/IP middleware from Zuken Elmic (formerly Elmic Systems) is also affected by some of these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities likely affect industrial control systems and medical devices. Please see ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-20-168-01 for more information. IMPACT The impact of these vulnerabilities will vary due to the combination of build and runtime options used while developing different embedded systems. This diversity of implementations and the lack of supply chain visibility has exasperated the problem of accurately assessing the impact of these vulnerabilities. In summary, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to use specially-crafted network packets to cause a denial of service, disclose information, or execute arbitrary code. RECOMMENDATIONS Following actions are recommended to be taken: Update to the latest stable version of Treck IP stack software (6.0.1.67 or later).
