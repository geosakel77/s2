Kaseya VSA is a software used by MSPs to remotely manage networks and endpoints. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Kaseya VSA that could allow for arbitrary code execution. These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if an attacker locates a vulnerable Kaseya Web interface. An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the running Kaseya server process. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Credentials leak and business logic flaw – CVE-2021-30116 XSS vulnerability – CVE-2021-30119 2FA bypass – CVE-2021-30120 Network IOCs 35.226.94[.]113 161.35.239[.]148 162.253.124[.]162 Endpoint IOCs Filename     MD5 Hash                    Function cert.exe    N/A – File with random string appended    Legit certutil.exe Utility agent.crt    939aae3cc456de8964cb182c75a5f8cc        Encoded malicious content agent.exe    561cffbaba71a6e8cc1cdceda990ead4        Decoded contents of agent.crt mpsvc.dll    a47cf00aedf769d60d58bfe00c0b5421        Ransomware Payload Web Log Indicators POST /dl.asp curl/7.69.1 GET /done.asp curl/7.69.1 POST /cgi-bin/KUpload.dll curl/7.69.1 GET /done.asp curl/7.69.1 POST /cgi-bin/KUpload.dll curl/7.69.1 POST /userFilterTableRpt.asp curl/7.69.1 Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Kaseya VSA On-premises versions prior to 9.5.7a (9.5.7.2994) RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates and recommendations provided by Kaseya to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
