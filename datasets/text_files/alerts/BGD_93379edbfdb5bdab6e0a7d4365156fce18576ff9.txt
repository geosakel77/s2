Magento is a web-based e-commerce application written in PHP. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Magento CMS, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerabilities are as follows: • An File Upload Allow List Bypass vulnerability could allow for Arbitrary Code Execution.
