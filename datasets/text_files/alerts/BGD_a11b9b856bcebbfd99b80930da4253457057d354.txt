Mozilla Thunderbird is an email client. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Mozilla Thunderbird, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potential risks in browser or browser-like contexts. Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows: * Two vulnerabilities that could be exploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2021-38500, CVE-2021-38501) * A downgrade attack that could allow a MITM to take control of the authenticated session to execute SMTP commands (CVE-2021-38502) * Two vulnerabilities that could result in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2021-38496, CVE-2021-38498) * A vulnerability that allowed for spoofing attacks (CVE-2021-38497) * A vulnerability that allowed for a potential memory leak (CVE-2021-32810) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Mozilla Thunderbird versions prior to 91.2 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Mozilla to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services REFERENCES: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-47/ https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38502 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38501 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38500 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38498 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38497 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38496 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32810 Published: 20 December 2021, 16:04:44 BST Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
