    Infections by Malware which Rewrites DNS Settings (DNS Changer)

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2012/at120008.html


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has obtained information regarding malware which rewrites 
DNS settings (DNS Changer). The DNS Changer malware was first detected 
in 2007. Currently, several tens of thousands of PCs worldwide are 
infected with DNS Changer. The number of infected computers located 
within Japan is also high.

  In November 2011, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) seized rogue DNS servers, replacing them with non-malicious DNS 
servers. However, it plans to shut these DNS servers down on March 9, 
2012 (Japanese time), so PCs infected with DNS Changer may not be able 
to view web sites, send e-mails, etc. on or after March 9, 2012.

*** Update: Added on 07.03.2012 **************************************
  DNS server operation has been extended by approximately 120 days as 
a result of a judgment by a US district court.

II. Confirmation Method

  Refer to the procedure below to confirm the DNS server information 
configured in PCs.

  1) Checking DNS configuration information in Microsoft Windows
    1. Start the command prompt.
      (for Windows 7):
      Click "Start Menu" - "Search Programs and Files". Enter "cmd.exe", 
      and click the displayed program.
      (for Windows XP):
      Click "Start Menu" - "Run...". Enter "cmd.exe", and click OK.
    2. At the command prompt, enter "ipconfig /all", and press Enter.
    3. Check for the lines in the displayed results that contain "DNS 
       Servers" (several IP addresses may be specified).
    * Check for each interface when multiple interfaces are used 
      (wireless LANs, wired LANs, etc.).

  * Please refer to the following site, which also contains the DNS 
    configuration information confirmation procedure.

    http://dcwg.org/checkup.html

  2) Check if the DNS server IP addresses confirmed in 1) fall within 
     the following IP address ranges.

     (Rogue DNS server IP address ranges)
    85.255.112.0 - 85.255.127.255
    67.210.0.0 - 67.210.15.255
    93.188.160.0 - 93.188.167.255
    77.67.83.0 - 77.67.83.255
    213.109.64.0 - 213.109.79.255
    64.28.176.0 - 64.28.191.255

     If any of the DNS servers have an IP address that falls in one of 
the above IP address ranges, the PC may be infected with DNS Changer. 
Refer to III and implement the solution described therein.


III. Solution

  If there is a possibility that the PC has been infected with DNS 
Changer, perform the solution below.

  - Disconnect the PC from the network. Follow the instructions of the 
    system administrator in confirming if the PC is infected with the 
    malware.

    * PCs infected with malware may have downloaded other malware, so 
      PCs infected with one type of malware may be infected by other 
      types of malware as well.

  - Change the PC's DHCP and IP address settings so that a valid DNS 
    server's IP address is used.

  The FBI has also confirmed a variety of DNS Changer that changes 
router DNS settings. If a PC DNS Changer infection is detected, also 
check if the router(s) used by the computer are also infected. For 
more information, refer to the following:
