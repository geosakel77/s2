The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service. Description The Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010 addresses 85 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components, including 31 vulnerabilities in Sun products. The Advisory provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. More detail about one of the vulnerabilities is available in US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#174089 . The Oracle Siebel Suite Executive Summary section of the Oracle Advisory notes, "None of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., none may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password." A system with the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control installed on it can be attacked remotely by an unauthenticated attacker by enticing the user to access a specially crafted HTML file (most likely a web site controlled by the attacker). Impact The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information. Solution Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010 . Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.
