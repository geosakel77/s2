I. Overview
On April 17, 2018 (local time), Oracle released critical patch updates
for multiple Oracle products.

    Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html

A remote attacker may cause the application to crash or execute
arbitrary code by leveraging these vulnerabilities. Users of the
affected products are recommended to update to the latest version
appropriately.


II. Affected Products
Products affected by these vulnerabilities include:

  - Java SE JDK/JRE 8 Update 162 and earlier
  - Java SE JDK/JRE 10
  - Oracle WebLogic Portal versions prior to 10.3.6.0.0 SPU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server versions prior to 10.3.6.0.180417 PSU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server versions prior to 12.1.3.0.180417 PSU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server versions prior to 12.2.1.2.180417 PSU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server versions prior to 12.2.1.3.180417 PSU

However, since there are many other versions and products affected by
these vulnerabilities, please refer to the information provided by
Oracle for more details.

In addition, there are cases where Java JRE is pre-installed on the PC
or Weblogic is used in software products for servers. Please check if
any of the affected products is included in the PCs or servers that
you use.

According to Oracle, Java SE, Java SE JDK/JRE 6 and 7, which had
already ended Public Updates, are also affected by these vulnerabilities.
As for Java SE JDK/JRE 9, Public Updates ended in March 2018.


III. Solution
Oracle has released updates for each product.
For Java SE and Weblogic, the following versions have been released:

  - Java SE JDK/JRE 8 Update 171
  - Java SE JDK/JRE 10.0.1
  - Oracle WebLogic Portal 10.3.6.0.0 SPU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server 10.3.6.0.180417 PSU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server 12.1.3.0.180417 PSU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.2.180417 PSU
  - Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.180417 PSU

Some applications that use affected products may not run properly
after updating the software to the latest version. Please update to
the latest version after considering any possible impacts to
applications that you may use.

In addition, for this Java SE JDK/JRE 8 Update, a patch set update
(8u172), including all of 8u171 plus additional features, is available
for developers and users. Please consider updating to 8u172 as
necessary, since it also includes fixes for issues other than these
vulnerabilities.

Users of 64-bit Windows may have 32-bit and/or 64-bit versions of
JDK/JRE installed. Please check the versions installed on your system
and apply the appropriate updates.

Users can check the version of Java that they are using at the page
below. If both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Java are installed,
please check the versions installed, using a 32-bit and 64-bit browser
respectively. (In environments where Java is not installed, there may
be a request to install Java. If you do not require Java, please do
not install.)
