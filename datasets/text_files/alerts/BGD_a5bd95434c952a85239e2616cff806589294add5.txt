SYSTEM AFFECTED Following actions are recommended to be taken: Install the latest version: • If you are using Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Drupal 7.73. • If you are using Drupal 8.8.x, upgrade to Drupal 8.8.10. • If you are using Drupal 8.9.x, upgrade to Drupal 8.9.6. • If you are using Drupal 9.0.x, upgrade to Drupal 9.0.6. RECOMMENDATIONS Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage. Sites on 8.7.x or earlier should update to 8.8.10. If you were previously relying on Drupal’s AJAX API to perform trusted JSONP requests, you’ll either need to override the AJAX options to set “jsonp: true”, or you’ll need to use the jQuery AJAX API directly. If you are using jQuery’s AJAX API for user-provided URLs in a contrib or custom module, you should review your code and set “jsonp: false” where this is appropriate.
