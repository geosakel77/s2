The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a TCP connection request when the IVR connection is already established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a crafted connection to the IP address of the targeted CVP device. An exploit could allow the attacker to disconnect the IVR to CVP connection, creating a DoS condition that prevents the CVP from accepting new, incoming calls while the IVR automatically attempts to re-establish the connection to the CVP. Impact : Denial of service (DoS) Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) Software Release 11.5(1). Mitigation : Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Please see the references or vendor advisory for more information.
