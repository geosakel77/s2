IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. A full list of all vulnerabilities can be found at the link below: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * .NET Core & Visual Studio * 3D Viewer * Microsoft DWM Core Library * Microsoft Intune * Microsoft Office * Microsoft Office Excel * Microsoft Office Outlook * Microsoft Office SharePoint * Microsoft Scripting Engine * Microsoft Windows Codecs Library * Paint 3D * Role: Hyper-V * Visual Studio Code – Kubernetes Tools * Windows Bind Filter Driver * Windows Common Log File System Driver * Windows Cryptographic Services * Windows DCOM Server * Windows Defender * Windows Drivers * Windows Event Logging Service * Windows Filter Manager * Windows HTML Platform * Windows Installer * Windows Kerberos * Windows Kernel * Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers * Windows Network File System * Windows NTFS * Windows NTLM * Windows Print Spooler Components * Windows Remote Desktop * Windows TCP/IP RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches or appropriate mitigations provided by Microsoft to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from untrusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
