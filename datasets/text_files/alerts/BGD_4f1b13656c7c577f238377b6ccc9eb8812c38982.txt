Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Adobe Acrobat and Reader * Use After Free, which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44701, CVE-2021-44704, CVE-2021-44706, CVE-2021-44710, CVE-2021-45062, CVE-2021-45064) * Improper Access Control which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-44702) * Stack-based Buffer Overflow which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44703) * Access of Uninitialized Pointer which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44705) * Out-of-bounds Write which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44707, CVE-2021-45061, CVE-2021-45068) * Heap-based Buffer Overflow which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44708, CVE-2021-44709) * Integer Overflow or Wraparound which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44711) * Improper Input Validation which could allow for Application denial-of-service. (CVE-2021-44712) * Use After Free which could allow for Application denial-of-service. (CVE-2021-44713) * Violation of Secure Design Principles which could allow for Security feature bypass. (CVE-2021-44714) * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for a Memory Leak. (CVE-2021-44715, CVE-2021-44742) * Improper Input Validation which could allow for Security feature bypass. (CVE-2021-44739) * NULL Pointer Dereference which could allow for Application denial-of-service. (CVE-2021-44740, CVE-2021-44741) * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-45060) * Use After Free which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-45063) * Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer which could allow for a Memory Leak. (CVE-2021-45067) Adobe Illustrator * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-43752, CVE-2021-44700) Adobe Bridge * Out-of-bounds Write which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-44743) * Use After Free which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-45051) * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-45052) * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for a Memory leak. (CVE-2021-44187, CVE-2021-44186, CVE-2021-44185) Adobe InCopy * Out-of-bounds Write which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-45053, CVE-2021-45056) * Use After Free which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-45054) * Out-of-bounds Read which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-45055) Adobe InDesign * Out-of-bounds Write which could allow for Arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-45057, CVE-2021-45058) * Use After Free which could allow for Privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-45059) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC 21.007.20099 and earlier versions for Windows. * Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC 21.007.20099 and earlier versions for macOS. * Acrobat 2020 and Acrobat Reader 2020 20.004.30017 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 17.011.30204 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Illustrator 2022 26.0.1 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Illustrator 2021 25.4.2 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Adobe Bridge 12.0 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Adobe Bridge 11.1.2 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Adobe InCopy 16.4 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. * Adobe InDesign 16.4 and earlier versions for Windows and macOS. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
