Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing and typesetting software that can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. Adobe FrameMaker is a document processor designed for writing and editing large or complex documents, including structured documents. Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), is a comprehensive content management solution for building websites, mobile apps and forms. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe InDesign, Adobe Framemaker, and Adobe Experience Manager the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows: • Adobe InDesign has five memory corruption vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2020-9727, CVE-2020-9728, CVE-2020-9729, CVE-2020-9730, CVE-2020-9731) • Adobe Framemaker has one stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2020-9725) • Adobe Framemaker has one out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2020-9726) • Adobe Experience Manager nine arbitrary javaScript execution in the browser vulnerabilities that could lead to stored cross-site scripting. (CVE-2020-9732, CVE-2020-9734, CVE-2020-9735, CVE-2020-9736, CVE-2020-9737, CVE-2020-9738, CVE-2020-9740, CVE-2020-9741, CVE-2020-9742) • Adobe Experience Manager has one execution with unnecessary privileges vulnerability that could cause sensitive information disclosure (CVE-2020-9733) • Adobe Experience Manager has one HTML injection vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary HTML injection in the browser (CVE-2020-9743) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED • Adobe InDesign 15.1.2 and earlier versions • Adobe Framemaker 2019.0.6 and earlier versions • Adobe Experience Manager 6.5.5.0 and earlier versions • Adobe Experience Manager 6.4.8.1 and earlier versions • Adobe Experience Manager 6.3.3.8 and earlier versions • Adobe Experience Manager 6.2 SP1-CFP20 and earlier versions • AEM Forms add-on Pack 5 and earlier versions RECOMMENDATIONS Following actions are recommended to be taken: • Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. • Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. • Remind users not to visit websites or follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. • Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. • Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services REFERENCES https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/indesign/apsb20-52.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/framemaker/apsb20-54.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb20-56.html https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9725 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9726 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9727 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9728 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9729 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9730 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9731 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9732 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9733 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9734 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9735 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9736 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9737 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9738 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9740 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9741 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9742 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9743 https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-adobe-indesign-adobe-framemaker-and-adobe-experience-manager-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution-apsb20-52-apsb20-54-apsb20-56_2020-129/ Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
