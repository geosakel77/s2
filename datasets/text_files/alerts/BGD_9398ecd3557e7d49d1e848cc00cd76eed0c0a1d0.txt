By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume, an attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header, resulting in a denial of service attack on the compute host. (The same code error also results in data loss, but that is not a vulnerability because the user loses their own data.) All Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected. Impact : Attackers can exploit this issue to cause denial-of-service conditions. OpenStack Nova 15.x through 15.1.0 and 16.x through 16.0.4 are vulnerable. Mitigation : Updates are available. Please see the references or vendor advisory for more information.
