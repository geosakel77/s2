              SNMPv3 Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

             http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2008/at080011.txt


I. Overview

  An authentication bypass vulnerability has been found in multiple
products that implement SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
version 3, a protocol commonly used to manage network devices. As a
result, device configuration information protected by the
authentication function may be disclosed, or a remote attacker may
change network device configurations.


II. Products Affected

  Products such as Cisco products, Juniper products, NET-SNMP, and
UCD-SNMP have been found to be affected by this vulnerability when
they use the SNMPv3 authentication function.

  For more information, refer to the following websites. For products
and systems not mentioned here, refer to each vendor's or
distributor's website.

III. Solution

  Apply a patch provided by the vendors or distributors. For the
latest information about the patches, refer to CERT/CCs' or vendors'
websites below.

  When application of a patch is difficult or an applicable patch has
not been released, workarounds are available. For example, it is
possible to restrict access to SNMP services using a packet filtering
function of a device such as a router.
(Although the port for SNMP service is usually 161/udp, it can vary
depending on the product.)
