Overview Various Oracle products and components are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include unauthenticated, remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service. Description Oracle released a Critical Patch Update in October 2005. It addresses more than eighty vulnerabilities in different Oracle products and components. The Critical Patch Update provides information about affected components, access and authorization required, and the impact of the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For more information on terms used in the Critical Patch Update, Metalink customers should refer to MetaLink Note 293956.1 . According to the Critical Patch Update: "The new database vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update do not affect Oracle Database Client-only installations (installations that do not have the Oracle Database Server installed). Therefore, it is not necessary to apply this Critical Patch Update to client-only installations if a prior Critical Patch Update, or Alert 68, has already been applied to the client-only installations." US-CERT recommends that sites running Oracle review the Critical Patch Update, apply patches, and take other mitigating action as appropriate. US-CERT is tracking all of these issues under VU#210524 . As further information becomes available, we will publish individual Vulnerability Notes . Note that according to public reports , the patches included in this update, as well as previous updates, may not adequately correct all security vulnerabilities. Impact The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include remote execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to gain access to sensitive information. Solution Apply a patch Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle Critical Patch Update - October 2005 . Note that this Critical Patch Update only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed. Workarounds It may be possible to mitigate some vulnerabilities by disabling or removing unnecessary components, restricting network access, and restricting access to temporary files. Oracle Critical Patch Update - October 2005 suggests disabling the PSQL Manager to mitigate a vulnerability in PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools (PSE04). Appendix A.
