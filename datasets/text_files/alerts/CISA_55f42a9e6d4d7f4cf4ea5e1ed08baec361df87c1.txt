The impacts of these vulnerabilities include unauthenticated, remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service. Description Oracle released a Critical Patch Update in July 2005 that addresses more than forty vulnerabilities in different Oracle products and components.  The Critical Patch Update provides information about which components are affected, what access and authorization are required, and how data confidentiality, integrity, and availability may be impacted.  Public reports describe vulnerabilities related to insecure password and temporary file handling and SQL injection. US-CERT strongly recommends that sites running Oracle review the Critical Patch Update, apply patches, and take other mitigating action as appropriate. Oracle HTTP Server is based on the Apache HTTP Server. Some Oracle products include Java components from Sun Microsystems.  According to Oracle , the July 2005 Critical Patch Update addresses previously disclosed vulnerabilities in Apache and Java.  Oracle also notes that Oracle Database Client-only installations are not affected by vulnerabilities listed in the July 2005 Critical Patch Update. US-CERT is tracking all of these issues under VU#613562 .  As further information becomes available, we will publish individual Vulnerability Notes . Impact The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary depending on product or component and configuration.  Potential consequences include remote execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to gain access to sensitive information. Solution Apply a patch Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle Critical Patch Update - July 2005 . The update notes that some Oracle patches are cumulative while others are not: The Oracle Database Server, Enterprise Manager, and the Oracle Application Server patches in the Updates are cumulative; each successive Critical Patch Update contains the fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates. E-Business Suite patches are not cumulative, so E-Business Suite customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous fixes they wish to apply. Oracle Collaboration Suite patches are not cumulative, so Oracle Collaboration Suite customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous fixes they wish to apply. Workarounds It may be possible to mitigate some vulnerabilities by disabling or removing unnecessary components, restricting network access, and restricting access to temporary files. Oracle Critical Patch Update - July 2005 suggests setting a TNS listner password to mitigate a vulnerability in Oracle Database Server (DB08). Appendix A.
