More Alerts Alert (SA04-208A) New Variant of MyDoom Virus Original release date: July 26, 2004 Systems Affected Microsoft Windows Systems Overview A new variant of the MyDoom virus is spreading through email. In
addition to infecting your computer and emailing itself to other
machines, the virus may open a backdoor that could make your machine
vulnerable to future attacks. Solution Avoid opening email attachments Be sure you know the source of an attachment before opening it. Also
remember that it is not enough that the mail originated from an email
address you recognize. Many viruses spread precisely because they
originate from a familiar email address. Maintain updated anti-virus software It is important that you use antivirus software and keep it up to
date. Most antivirus software vendors frequently release updated
information, tools, or virus databases to help detect and recover from
virus infections. Many antivirus packages support automatic updates of
virus definitions. US-CERT recommends using these automatic updates
when possible. Description This variant of MyDoom (known as MyDoom.M or  MyDoom.O) is significant because it seems to be 
conducting searches on
addresses it harvests from infected computers. Therefore, not only is
email activity affected, response times in many popular search engines
may be dramatically slower.
