                  &lt;&lt;&lt; JPCERT/CC Alert 2010-10-01 &gt;&gt;&gt;

       Attacks using exploit packs via websites are on the rise

             https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2010/at100025.txt


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has been observing multiple attacks that use exploit packs 
to infect a user's PC with malware when the user browses a website. 

The attacker alters the contents of a website or the contents of 
advertisements on a website by using methods such as SQL injection. 
When a user browses an altered website, the user is redirected to a 
website where an exploit pack has been placed by an attacker, and 
malware may be installed on the user's PC by exploiting multiple 
vulnerabilities. 

  A PC infected by this malware may be affected in ways such as a false 
security software being installed, or becoming subject to a bot 
infection. 

Check that software installed on the computer is up to date, and 
perform updates if required. 


II. Vulnerabilities exploited by exploit packs

  JPCERT/CC has confirmed that vulnerabilities of the following 
products are being exploited by exploit packs. 

  Vulnerabilities exploited by exploit packs
  - Adobe Acrobat, Reader, Flash Player from Adobe Systems
  - Microsoft Windows from Microsoft
  - Java (JRE) from Oracle

The vulnerabilities include those published in 2010.


III. Solution

  As far as JPCERT/CC has confirmed, exploited vulnerabilities of the 
above software have already been fixed. Therefore, malware infection 
can be prevented by applying the corresponding corrected software to 
each product.

Refer to the following procedures and update the software.

* The following software may be preinstalled in some PCs provided by 
certain manufacturers. Just in case, it is recommended to make sure 
whether the software is installed on the PC.

  [Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader]
