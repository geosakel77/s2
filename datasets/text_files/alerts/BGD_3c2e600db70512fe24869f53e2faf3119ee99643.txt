If accepted, a NOTIFY sets the zone refresh interval to ‘now’.  If there is not already a refresh cycle in progress then named will initiate one by asking for the SOA RR from its list of masters.  If there is already a refresh cycle in progress, then named will queue the new refresh request.  If there is already a queued refresh request, the new NOTIFY will be discarded. Bogus notifications can’t be used to force a zone transfer from a malicious server, but could trigger a high rate of zone refresh cycles. Mitigation : Security update is available in official site.
