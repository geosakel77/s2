                  Alert regarding website compromise

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2016/at160047.html


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has been receiving various reports on website compromise. 
According to these reports, attackers have compromised a number of
domestic websites by placing malicious files on the web server,
designed to inspect the websites including its access counts and
visitors.

  - Attackers place a malicious file on the web server named
    'index_old.php' and add a process (shown below) on the homepage
    which makes the browser load this malicious file
<script src="./index_old.php" type="text/javascript">
</script>
- When a user visits a compromised website, the above malicious file
    is executed, and the visitors IP address and time of visit is
    recorded as a log.

  In addition to above mentioned inspection, attackers also seem to be
conducting searching activities to see if the websites can be exploited
for use in cyber attacks, such as water hole attacks.
  Website administrators should refer to information provided in
"II. Solution" to check whether the contents of their website have been
compromised or not and consider applying any necessary countermeasures.


II. Solution

  Please consider the following check points and countermeasures:

  (Check points)
  - Check for any process to load malicious files, such as the
    following in the homepage of the website
<script src="./index_old.php" type="text/javascript">
</script>
- Check the public facing contents of the website for any malicious
    files or compromised contents
  - Check the FTP/SSH logs and web application access logs for any
    suspicious source IP addresses, access times, request URIs, etc.

  * If any suspicious activity is discovered, isolate the web server,
    change the account passwords for website maintenance, and report
    to JPCERT/CC

  (Countermeasures)
  - Apply security updates to the OS and software used on the web
    server
  - Disable 20, 21/TCP (FTP), 23/TCP (TELNET) and perform website
    maintenance through a secure protocol, such as SSH
  - Restrict the PC (IP address) that can be used for website
    maintenance
  - Change the password for website maintenance account (SSH/CMS etc.) 
    to a strong one
  - Obtain a backup of the website contents, and periodically check
    for any differences
