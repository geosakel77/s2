             Alert Regarding Vulnerability in ISC BIND 9

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2017/at170024.html


I. Overview
ISC BIND 9 contains a vulnerability in TSIG. When this vulnerability is
exploited, a remote attacker may conduct unauthorized DNS dynamic update
(CVE-2017-3143) and zone transfer (CVE-2017-3142).
This vulnerability has impacts when access restriction by TSIG is enabled.
For more details on this vulnerability, please refer to the information
provided by ISC.

    Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (ISC)
    CVE-2017-3143: An error in TSIG authentication can permit unauthorized dynamic updates
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01503/

    Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (ISC)
    CVE-2017-3142: An error in TSIG authentication can permit unauthorized zone transfers
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01504/

The vulnerability CVE-2017-3143 has impacts if an attacker can send and
receive messages to authoritative DNS servers and has the valid TSIG
key name of the target zone and service.

** Update: July 13, 2017 Update **************************************
ISC updated the advisory. The local update policy (configured with
"update-policy local;" in named.conf) implicitly defines a TSIG key
with a known key name (local-ddns) and default algorithm and no IP-based
access controls on the zone updates. If you are using the affected
version version, please confirm the settings.
**********************************************************************

The vulnerability CVE-2017-3142 has impacts if an attacker is able to
send and receive messages to authoritative DNS servers and has the valid
TSIG key name. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending constructed
request packets to circumvent TSIG authentication.
In addition, ISC has rated the severity of the vulnerability CVE-2017-3143
as "High" and CVE-2017-3142 as "Medium". 

If you are operating an affected version of ISC BIND 9, please consider
updating to a version that addresses this vulnerability by referring to
the information in "III. Solution".


II. Affected Systems
According to ISC, the following versions are affected by this
vulnerability.
In addition, this vulnerability is affected when TSIG access restriction
is enabled.

  - CVE-2017-3143 : High
    - Versions from 9.9.0 to 9.9.10-P1
    - Versions from 9.10.0 to 9.10.5-P1
    - Versions from 9.11.0 to 9.11.1-P1
    - Versions 9.4.x to 9.8.x which are no longer supported are also
      affected

  - CVE-2017-3142 : Medium
    - Versions from 9.9.0 to 9.9.10-P1
    - Versions from 9.10.0 to 9.10.5-P1
    - Versions from 9.11.0 to 9.11.1-P1
    - Versions 9.4.x to 9.8.x which are no longer supported are also
      affected

For more details, please refer to the following:

    BIND 9 Security Vulnerability Matrix
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00913/

If you are using BIND provided by a distributor, please refer to the
information provided by that distributor.


III. Solution
ISC has released versions of ISC BIND that address these vulnerabilities.
Distributors are likely to provide their own versions that address
these vulnerabilities. Consider updating to an updated version after
thorough testing.

Versions that address these vulnerabilities are as follows:

  ISC BIND
  - BIND 9 version 9.9.10-P2
  - BIND 9 version 9.10.5-P2
  - BIND 9 version 9.11.1-P2


IV. Workaround
According to ISC, the effects of this vulnerability can be mitigated
by applying the following workarounds.

  - Use Access Control List (ACL) that require both IP address range
    validation and TSIG authentication in conjunction

    Using Access Control Lists (ACLs) with both addresses and keys
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00723

** Update: July 13, 2017 Update **************************************
Administrators who have made use of named.conf option "update-policy local;"
should patch their servers as soon as possible.
If this is not possible should replace the update-policy configuration
statement implementing the key requirement for updates but additionally
imposing an IP ACL limitation.

    allow-update { !{ !localhost; }; key local-ddns; };
