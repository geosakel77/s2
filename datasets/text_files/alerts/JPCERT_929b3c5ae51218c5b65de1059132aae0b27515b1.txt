               Increased activity targeting TCP port 445

             http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2008/at080019.txt

I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC Internet Scan Data Acquisition System (ISDAS) has observed
that scans against TCP port 445 have been increasing since late
evening on October 30, 2008. The increasing scans are mainly from
inside Japan and from China. Although the cause of these scans has not
been identified yet, they may be infection attempts by worms
exploiting a Server service vulnerability in Microsoft Windows
products (MS08-067), for which a security update has been recently
released.


II. Observation status

  For the TCP port 445 scan trends observed by ISDAS, refer to the
following website:

III. Solution

  Users of the services running on TCP port 445 are recommended to
consider taking the following countermeasures:

   1) When using a Microsoft Windows product, apply the security
      update according to "IV. References".

   2) In order to prevent secondary damage from virus infection,
      restrict packets from internal to external TCP port 445.
