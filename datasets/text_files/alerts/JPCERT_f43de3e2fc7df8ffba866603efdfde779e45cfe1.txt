                Scan activity targeting TCP port 3389

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2011/at110024.txt

I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC Internet Scan Data Acquisition System (ISDAS) has observed 
that scans against TCP port 3389 have been increasing since late 
August of 2011. Although the cause of these scans has not been 
identified yet, they may be due to the Morto malware, which scans for 
ports offering Windows RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) services, and 
then attempts to crack the password. After scanning, this malware 
attempts to crack weak passwords and propagate itself.
  ISDAS has observed scanning activity from multiple IP addresses in 
Japan, and has notified their respective administrators.
  Since August 28, 2011, the amount of scanning of TCP 3389 has 
decreased, but there is the possibility that malware activity has been 
temporarily suspended, and attention is still required.
Please consider implementing the solution in IV. Solution.


II. Observation status

  For the TCP port 3389 scan trends observed by ISDAS, refer to the 
following websites:

III. Malware activity confirmed by JPCERT/CC

  JPCERT/CC has obtained one type of malware (Morto) which is believed
to be performing this scan, and has verified how it operates.

  1. Computers infected with this malware send requests to DNS servers, 
     and scan TCP port 3389 of nearby IP addresses.
  2. When a computer responds to the scan, the computer infected with 
     the malware attempts to login to the target computer via RDP.
     - Examples of targeted user IDs:
       administrator, admin, test, user, guest, 
       support_388945a0 (remote assistance default ID), etc.
  3. When the computer infected with the malware succeeds in logging 
     into the target computer, it infects the target computer.
  4. The computer infected with the malware in 3 begins scanning 
     activity from step 1 above.


IV. Solution

  Users of the services running on RDP (TCP port 3389) are recommended 
to consider taking the following countermeasures:

   1) Not to use a vulnerable password for system accounts.

   2) Restrict remote login of accounts which do not need to be logged 
      into remotely

   3) As needed, have routers and/or firewalls perform access control 
      of external access to TCP port 3389
