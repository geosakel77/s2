     Alert Regarding Vulnerability (CVE-2021-25218) in ISC BIND 9

       https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2021/at210035.html


I. Overview
ISC BIND 9 contains a vulnerability. If named attempts to respond over
UDP with a response that is larger than the current effective interface
maximum transmission unit (MTU), and if response-rate limiting (RRL)
is active, an assertion failure is triggered. A remote attacker
leveraging the vulnerability may cause named to terminate unexpectedly.

ISC has rated the vulnerability CVE-2021-25218 as "High". For more
information on the vulnerability, please refer to the information
provided by ISC.

    Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (ISC)
    CVE-2021-25218: A too-strict assertion check could be triggered when responses in BIND 9.16.19 and 9.17.16 require UDP fragmentation if RRL is in use
    https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25218

If you are operating an affected version of ISC BIND 9, please consider
updating to a version that addresses the vulnerability by referring
to the information in "III. Solution".


II. Affected Products and Versions
According to ISC, the following versions are affected by the
vulnerability.

  - BIND 9.17.16
  - BIND 9.16.19
  - BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition 9.16.19-S1

This vulnerability only affects the above versions. 

RRL is only enabled for the CHAOS (CH) class by default. If you are
using BIND provided by a distributor, please refer to the information
provided by that distributor.


III. Solution
ISC has released fixed versions of ISC BIND 9 that address the
vulnerability. Distributors will provide their own versions that
address the vulnerability. Consider updating to a fixed version after
thorough testing.

  - BIND 9.17.17
  - BIND 9.16.20
  - BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition 9.16.20-S1

As a workaround, ISC recommends removing all existing rate-limit
statements from named.conf to disable RRL for all classes including
CHAOS and defining a replacement for the default CHAOS view.
