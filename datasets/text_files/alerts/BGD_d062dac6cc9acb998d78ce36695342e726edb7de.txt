The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to execute remote code on the affected system. IMPACT Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iTunes. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: An out-of-bounds write issue was addressed with improved bounds checking.

This issue was addressed with improved path sanitization. (CVE-2020-9900) A local user may be able to load unsigned kernel extensions. (CVE-2020-9939) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to execute remote code on the affected system. SYSTEM AFFECTED iOS prior to 13.6 iPadOS prior to 13.6 macOS prior to 10.15.6 tvOS prior to 13.4.8 watchOS prior to 6.2.8 iTunes prior to 12.10.8 RECOMMENDATIONS Following actions are recommended to be taken: Apply appropriate patches provided by Apple to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. Remind users not to download, accept, or execute files from un-trusted or unknown sources. Remind users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
