  Improperly setup Asterisk may be exploited for malicious purposes

              https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2010/at100032.txt


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has confirmed cases where Asterisk used with insufficient
security measures applied has resulted in unauthorized use such as 
unintended international phone calls being made by a third party.

  * Asterisk is an IP-PBX (Intenet Protocol Private Branch eXchange)
    open source software that functions as an SIP server.

  It is assumed that the attacker broadcasts SIP communication 
5060/udp packets over the Internet, and performs brute-force attacks
on responding SIP servers in order to identify IDs and passwords 
required to make calls on an IP phone.  Subsequently, the attacker 
uses the identified IDs and passwords to make unauthorized 
international calls.

  As a result,  if security measures applied to the IP-PBX are 
insufficient, an attacker could make unauthorized use of an operating
IP-PBX, which may result in being invoiced for international calls at
a later date.

  It is assumed that the attacks are performed on any IP-PBX. However,
multiple cases have been confirmed where Asterisk users especially 
have been billed large amounts for international calls.

The major cause is assumed to be that the applied security measures 
were insufficient such as using sample passwords that are known to 
the public or using easily guessable user names and passwords when 
configuring Asterisk.

II. Cases reported to JPCERT/CC

  JPCERT/CC has received a report concerning a host that was 
performing attacks on SIP servers.
The attack on the SIP server confirmed in the report involved the use 
of exploit tools released on the Internet to perform dictionary 
attacks in order to identify user (peer) names and passwords. The 
dictionary used in the attack consisted mostly of numbers, words, and
people's names.

  [Examples of character strings in the dictionary]
    - Combinations of numbers from one digit up to twelve digits
      * This includes the sample password "1234"
    - Words and people's names
      coffee, japan, key, account, admin, password, pass, sip, test,
      voip, alice, bobby, michael , etc.
    - Combinations of simple character strings and numbers
      abcd123, pass1234, password1, pw1, passw0rd, etc.

III. Solution

Consider the following measures in order to prevent unauthorized 
external use of Asterisk. (This solution is written based on information
from VoIP Info.jp and material provide by NTT-CERT)


******* Solutions recommended by VoIP Info.jp and NTT-CERT from here *******

  1) If not necessary, do not make Asterisk available over the Internet.
     - Put Asterisk behind a gateway (routers, etc.) (do not connect
       it directly to the Internet)

     - Using firewall functions of the gateway, etc., block external 
       packets sent to Asterisk.

     - If connections over the Internet to Asterisk is necessary, use 
       VPN connections.

  2) Reject calls by guest users (number unconfigured).
     - Unless there are special reasons to allow guest connections, 
       set allowguest=no in sip.conf (when allowguest is not specified, 
       calls by guest users will be allowed by default.)

  3) Apply measures against brute-force attacks
     - Set appropriate SIP user (peer) names and passwords for REGISTER
        - Use long passwords.  Combine upper and lower cases, numbers 
          and symbols to create passwords at least 8 characters long, 
          or if possible 14 or more characters long.
        - Use long user names (extension numbers and SIP user names do
          not need to be the same).
     - Apply a filter based on port numbers and source IP addresses
        - On the server where Asterisk is installed, use iptables etc.
          to allow only those ports used for communication
          - If permitted IP addresses are known, specify those IP addresses
        - Provide access control using the configuration file of Asterisk
          (exampe: sip.conf)
          deny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
          permit=(call permitted address)/255.255.255.0
        - Perform filtering using firewall functions of the gateway, etc.
          - Configure externally connected routers and firewalls etc. 
            to allow only SIP/RTP traffic to Asterisk
          - If permitted IP addresses are known, specify those IP addresses
     - Use domain authentication
        - Reject REGISTER requests from all domains except for the one specified.
          (exampe: sip.conf)
          domain=jpcert.or.jp
     - Remove unnecessary (unused) users 
     - Change replies to non-existing users from 404 to 403
         (exampe: sip.conf)
         alwaysauthreject=yes
     - Monitor the logs to detect brute-force attacks trying to 
       identify user names and passwords
         (examples of log files when installed on a Linux system)
         /var/log/asterisk/messages
         /var/log/asterisk/cd-r-csv/Master.csv

  4) Apply measures to prevent unauthorized out-going calls
     - Change the external call prefix to special numbers
       - Prohibit out-going calls unless a special prefix (number) is
         added when making out-going calls
     - Prohibit calls based on source extension number
       - Divide extension numbers into those permitted to call outside
         and those not (refer to Appendix 2)
     - Restrict calls by destination
       - If 010 (international call prefix), 00 (calls specifying a 
         relay telephone carrier) Restrict calls to specified external numbers
         (refer to Appendix 3)

  * Note that if international calls will not be made at all, 
     disabling international calls may be possible depending on your 
     telephone carrier. Consult your telephone carrier.

 (For you information) Other recommended solutions
  1) Do not launch Asterisk services with root permission
     - Since the default installation launches with root permission, 
       configure Asterisk to launch services with general user 
       permission (example user name: asterisk)

  2) Limit access to the administration interface if the administration
     interface is used
     - When using CLI functions after logging in from remote, use, for
       example, SSH (public key authentication) and restrict access
       using TCP Wrapper
     - When using the administration interface (AMI), use manager.conf
       to configure access restrictions

* Multiple versions of Asterisk exist. The configuration examples
  introduced here have been confirmed using Asterisk 1.6.2.12-rc1. 
  Configurations may differ depending on the version used, so refer to
  the product documentation or vendor information for details.

* Configuration examples of Appendix 1 - 3 are posted on the following
  URL so please refer to them as well.

****** End of solutions recommended by VoIP Info.jp and NTT-CERT *****

  Note that, depending on your telecommunication carrier, applying the
solutions may disrupt connectivity. Therefore, consult your carrier as
necessary.

  In addition to applying the solutions, JPCERT/CC recommends checking
the detailed phone bills for unauthorized use.

  Furthermore, check whether your operating systems and software are up
to date, and update them if necessary. For those using other IP-PBX 
systems, refer to the solutions and consider applicable security 
measures.
