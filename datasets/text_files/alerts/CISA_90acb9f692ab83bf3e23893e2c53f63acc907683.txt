Researchers have discovered a new variant of the Conficker Worm on April 9, 2009.  This variant updates earlier infections via its peer to peer (P2P) network as well as resuming scan-and-infect activity against unpatched systems. Public reporting indicates that this variant attempts to download additional malicious code onto victim systems, possibly including copies of the Waledac Trojan, a spam-oriented malicious application which has previously propagated only via bogus email messages containing malicious links. Description Home users can apply a simple test for the presence of a Conficker/Downadup infection on their home computers.  The presence of a Conficker/Downadup infection may be detected if a user is unable to surf to their security solution website or if they are unable to connect to the websites, by downloading detection/removal tools available free from those sites: http://www.symantec.com/norton/theme.jsp?themeid=conficker_worm&inid=us_ghp_link_conficker_worm http://www.microsoft.com/protect/computer/viruses/worms/conficker.mspx http://www.mcafee.com If a user is unable to reach any of these websites, it may indicate a Conficker/Downadup infection.  The most recent variant of Conficker/Downadup interferes with queries for these sites, preventing a user from visiting them.  If a Conficker/Downadup infection is suspected, the system or computer should be removed from the network or unplugged from the Internet - in the case for home users. Impact A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Solution Instructions, support and more information on how to manually remove a Conficker/Downadup infection from a system have been published by major security vendors.  Please see below for a few of those sites. Each of these vendors offers free tools that can verify the presence of a Conficker/Downadup infection and remove the worm: Symantec: http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-011316-0247-99 Microsoft: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/962007 http://www.microsoft.com/protect/computer/viruses/worms/conficker.mspx Microsoft PC Safety hotline at 1-866-PCSAFETY, for assistance.
