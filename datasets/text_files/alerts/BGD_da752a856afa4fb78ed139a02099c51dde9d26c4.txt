Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * A blind SQL injection in the user interface of FortiWeb may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries or     commands by sending a request with a crafted Authorization header containing a malicious SQL statement. (CVE-2020-29015) * A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in FortiWeb may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to overwrite the content of the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted request with a large certname. (CVE-2020-29016) * A format string vulnerability in FortiWeb may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read the content of memory and retrieve sensitive data via the redir parameter. (CVE-2020-29018) * A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in FortiWeb may allow a remote, authenticated attacker to crash the httpd daemon thread by sending a request with a crafted cookie header. (CVE-2020-29019) IMPACT Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the affected application. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED *FortiWeb versions 6.3.7 and below. *FortiWeb versions 6.2.3 and below. RECOMMENDATIONS The following actions are recommended: * Apply appropriate updates by Fortinet to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources.
