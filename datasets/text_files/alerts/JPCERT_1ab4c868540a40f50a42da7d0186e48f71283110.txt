(3) Windows 10 Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34481)

On July 20, 2021, Microsoft released an advisory on the Privilege
Elevation Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-36934) in multiple versions of
Windows 10. A user may read system files including the Security
Accounts Manager (SAM) database, and as a result, escalate to obtain
SYSTEM privileges.

Although this month's security update include fix for the vulnerability,
in order to fully mitigate the impact of the vulnerability, it is
necessary to manually delete all shadow copies of system files,
including the SAM database, that have been obtained before the update
or workarounds is applied. For details, please refer to the information
provided by Microsoft. Since the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code that
exploits the vulnerability has already been made public, it is
recommended to consider taking immediate actions.

(4) Windows LSA Spoofing Vulnerability (CVE-2021-36942) and mitigating for NTLM Relay Attacks

The Windows LSA spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2021-36942) is related to
the NTLM Relay Attack Advisory (ADV210003), which was the advisory
published on July 23, 2021. By exploiting the vulnerability, an
unauthenticated attacker may coerce the domain controller to authenticate
against another server using NTLM. This vulnerability affects all servers
but Microsoft added that domain controllers should be prioritized in
terms of applying security updates.

Also, to prevent NTLM Relay Attacks on networks with NTLM enabled,
Microsoft has provided mitigations for NTLM Relay Attacks. Active
Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), that is used with either
"Certificate Authority Web Enrollment" or "Certificate Enrollment Web
Service" is potentially vulnerable to this attack. Since the
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code that perform these attacks has already
been made public, it is recommended to apply mitigations as soon as
possible.
