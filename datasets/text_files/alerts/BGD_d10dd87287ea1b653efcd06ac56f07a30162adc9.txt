In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in ‘enc_part’ instead of the unencrypted version stored in ‘ticket’. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated. Impact : Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to bypass certain security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack. This may lead to other attacks. Mitigation: Updates are available. Please check specific vendor advisory for more information.
