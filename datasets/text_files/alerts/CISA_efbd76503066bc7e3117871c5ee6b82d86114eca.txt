More Alerts Alert (TA05-312A) Microsoft Windows Image Processing Vulnerabilities Original release date: November 08, 2005 Systems Affected Microsoft Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows XP Microsoft Windows Server 2003 For more complete information, refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-053 . Overview Microsoft has released updates that address critical vulnerabilities in Windows graphics rendering services. A remote, unauthenticated attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on an affected system. Description The Microsoft Security Bulletin for November 2005 addresses multiple buffer overflows in Windows image processing routines. Viewing a specially crafted image from an application that uses a vulnerable routine may trigger these vulnerabilities. If this application can access images from remote sources, such as web sites or email, then remote exploitation is possible. Further information is available in the following US-CERT Vulnerability Notes: VU#300549 -
