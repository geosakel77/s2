Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Acrobat, Animate, Illustrator, and InDesign, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Adobe Acrobat and Reader * Out-of-bounds read error vulnerability, which could allow for memory leak. (CVE-2021-28557) * Out-of-bounds read error vulnerabilities, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28555, CVE-2021-28565) * Out-of-bounds write error vulnerabilities, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28564, CVE-2021-21044, CVE-2021-21038, CVE-2021-21086) Adobe Animate * Use-after-free error vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28578). * Out-of-bound write error vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28577) * Out-of-bounds read error vulnerabilities, which could allow for information disclosure. (CVE-2021-28572, CVE-2021-28573, CVE-2021-28574, CVE-2021-28575, CVE-2021-28576) Adobe Experience Manager * Improper access control vulnerability, which could allow for denial-of-service. (CVE-2021-21083) * Cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary JavaScript execution. (CVE-2021-21084) Adobe InCopy * Path traversal vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21090) Adobe InDesign * Out-of-bounds write error vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21098, CVE-2021-21099, CVE-2021-21043) Adobe Illustrator * Out-of-bounds write error vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21101) * Path traversal vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21102) * Memory corruption error vulnerabilities, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-21103, CVE-2021-21104, CVE-2021-21105) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Acrobat 2020 and Acrobat Reader 2020 versions prior to 2020.001.30025 * Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 versions prior to 2017.011.30196 * Adobe Animate versions prior to 21.06 * Adobe Experience Manager versions prior to 6.4.8.4 and 6.5.8.0 * Adobe InCopy versions prior to 16.2.1 * Adobe InDesign versions prior to 16.2.1 * Adobe Illustrator versions prior to 25.2.3 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
