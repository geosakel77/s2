Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Media Encoder, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK, and Adobe Captivate, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * Eleven arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities exist when Adobe accesses a memory location after the end of a buffer (CVE-2021-36046, CVE-2021-36049, CVE-2021-36052, CVE-2021-36059, CVE-2021-36067, CVE-2021-36068, CVE-2021-36069, CVE-2021-36070, CVE-2021-36076, CVE-2021-36077, CVE-2021-36078) * Six arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities exist due a to a buffer overflow (CVE-2021-36050, CVE-2021-36051, CVE-2021-36054, CVE-2021-36057, CVE-2021-36065, CVE-2021-36073, CVE-2021-36075) * Four application denial-of-service vulnerabilities exist (CVE-2021-36053, CVE-2021-36054, CVE-2021-36055, CVE-2021-36056) * Two arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities exist due to improper input validation (CVE-2021-36047, CVE-2021-36048) * Two arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities exist due to an out-of-bounds write (CVE-2021-36066, CVE-2021-36072) * One arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists due to a buffer underwrite (CVE-2021-36064) * One arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists due to an integer overflow (CVE-2021-36058) * One arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists due to an out-of-bounds read (CVE-2021-36079) * One memory leak vulnerability exists due to an out-of-bounds read (CVE-2021-36074) * One privilege escalation vulnerability exists when Adobe Captivate creates a temporary file in a directory with incorrect permissions (CVE-2021-36002) * Two arbitrary file system read vulnerabilities exist due to an out-of-bounds read (CVE-2021-36071, CVE-2021-36079) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Adobe Captivate 11.5.5 and earlier versions * Adobe XMP-Toolkit-SDK 2020.1 and earlier versions * Adobe Photoshop 2020 21.2.10 and earlier versions * Adobe Photoshop 2021 22.4.3 and earlier versions * Adobe Bridge 11.1 and earlier versions * Adobe Media Encoder 15.4 and earlier versions RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Adobe to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services REFERENCES: https://helpx.adobe.com/security/security-bulletin.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/media-encoder/apsb21-70.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/bridge/apsb21-69.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/photoshop/apsb21-68.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/xmpcore/apsb21-65.html https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/captivate/apsb21-60.html Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
