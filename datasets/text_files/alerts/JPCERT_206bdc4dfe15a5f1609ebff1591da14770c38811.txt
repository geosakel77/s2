According to Oracle, the following measures can mitigate the impact of
vulnerabilities, but it is highly recommended to perform a verification
test as some applications may not work properly after the measures are
implemented.

  - Block network protocols used by attacks with FW or other device.
  - For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, remove the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges
**********************************************************************

Some applications that use affected products may not run properly
after updating the software to the latest version. Please update to
the latest version after considering any possible impacts to
applications that you may use.

Users of 64-bit Windows may have 32-bit and/or 64-bit versions of
JDK/JRE installed. Please check the versions installed on your system
and apply the appropriate updates.

Users can check the version of Java that they are using at the page
below. If both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Java are installed,
please check the versions installed, using a 32-bit and 64-bit browser
respectively. (In environments where Java is not installed, there may
be a request to install Java. If you do not require Java, please do
not install.)
