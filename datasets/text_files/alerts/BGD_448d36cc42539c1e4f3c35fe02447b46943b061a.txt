Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Several of the previous vulnerabilities have been found in macOS, an operating system for Apple desktops and laptops. Additional new vulnerabilities have also been discovered, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution with system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete any data. IMPACT: There are reports of the following vulnerabilities currently being actively exploited in the wild: * CVE-2021-1782: iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS vulnerability that enables privilege escalation. * CVE-2021-1870: WebKit vulnerability that enables arbitrary code execution. * CVE-2021-1800: Xcode vulnerability that enables arbitrary file access. * CVE-2021-1782: macOS vulnerability that enables privilege escalation. * CVE-2021-1870 and CVE-2021-1871: macOS vulnerability that enables arbitrary code execution. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * iOS versions prior to iOS 14.4 * iPadOS versions prior to iPadOS 14.4 * tvOS versions prior to tvOS 14.4 * watchOS versions prior to watchOS 7.3 * Xcode versions prior to Xcode 12.4 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Apple to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a nonprivileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to download, accept or execute files from untrusted and unknown sources. * Remind users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by untrusted or unknown sources. * Evaluate read, write, and execute permissions on all newly installed software. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
