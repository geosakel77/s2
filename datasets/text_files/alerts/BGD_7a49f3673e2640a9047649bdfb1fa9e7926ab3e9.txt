The publically accessible testCredential.do endpoint takes multiple user inputs and validates supplied credentials by accessing a specific system. This endpoint calls several internal classes and then executes a PowerShell script. If the specified system is an Office SharePoint Server, then the username and password parameters to this script are not validated, leading to command injection. Impact : Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in remote code execution in the context of the affected system. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of this vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. System Affected: ManageEngine Applications Manager 13.5 Mitigation : The following actions are recommended: Install appropriate updates provided by ManageEngine as they become available and appropriate testing has been completed. Verify no unauthorized system modifications have occurred on the system before applying the anticipated patch. Monitor intrusion detection systems for any signs of anomalous activity. Unless required, limit external network access to affected product.
