  Zero-day Vulnerability in Windows Help and Support Center Protocol

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2010/at100016.txt


I. Overview

  On June 11, 2010, Microsoft published an advisory for a zero-day 
vulnerability in the Windows Help and Support Center function included 
in Windows XP/2003. Windows Help and Support Center contains an hcp:// 
URI processing vulnerability. As a result, when a user views a 
specially crafted web page, arbitrary code may be executed.

  On June 28, 2010, JPCERT/CC confirmed that this vulnerability had 
been used in website alteration attacks by the "so-called Gumblar 
viruses".

  This alert has been issued in anticipation of future outbreak of 
attacks exploiting this vulnerability.

    Microsoft Security Advisory (2219475)
    Vulnerability in Windows Help and Support Center Could Allow Remote Code Execution

    http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2219475.mspx


II. Products Affected

   Affected products and versions are as follows:
  - Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3
  - Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2
  - Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2
  - Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2
  - Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems

  For more information, refer to the Microsoft Security Advisory 
(2219475).


III. Result of JPCERT/CC Verification

  JPCERT/CC has examined some publicly-released exploit code, and 
confirmed that arbitrary code is executed. 

[Verification environment]
  - Windows XP SP3 (all the released patches applied) and the latest 
    version of IE7/IE8
    IE7 (7.0.5730.13, the latest patch applied)
    IE8 (8.0.6001.18702, the latest patch applied)

[Verification result]
  By executing an exploit code in the above environment, JPCERT/CC has 
  confirmed that the arbitrary code is executed. Also, after applying 
  the mitigation measure (Microsoft Fix it) provided by Microsoft, 
  JPCERT/CC has confirmed that the arbitrary code does not execute 
  when executing the exploit code.

  Moreover, after examining the attacking code used in the website 
alteration attacks by the "so-called Gumblar viruses", JPCERT/CC has 
confirmed that arbitrary code is executed in some environments.

[Verification environment]
  - Windows XP SP3 (all the released patches applied) and the latest 
    version of IE7/IE8
      IE7 (7.0.5730.13, the latest patch applied)
      IE8 (8.0.6001.18702, the latest patch applied)

[Verification result]
  Execution of arbitrary code has been confirmed in the IE7 
  environment. On the other hand, arbitrary code was not executed in 
  the IE8 environment. This is because the attacking code is designed 
  to check the User Agent header from the web browser and executes the 
  code only targeting IE7. If the code is modified by any attacker, 
  arbitrary code will also be executed on IE8.

*** Update: Added on July 14, 2010 *******************************
  On July 14, 2010, Microsoft released a security update. JPCERT/CC 
  has confirmed that the exploit code does not execute after applying 
  this update.
******************************************************************


IV. Solution

  As of June 28, 2010, no security update has been released from 
Microsoft.

*** Update: Added on July 14, 2010 *******************************
  Microsoft has released a security update.

  Apply the update immediately by using means such as Microsoft Update 
  or Windows Update.

******************************************************************


V. Mitigation measures

  Microsoft has announced the following mitigation measure against 
this vulnerability. Please consider applying this measure after taking 
into account the possible impacts on the systems.

  - Unregister the HCP protocol
    Unregistering the HCP protocol will break all local, legitimate 
    help links that use hcp://. According to Microsoft, links in 
    Control Panel may no longer work.

  Also, Microsoft provides "Microsoft Fix it" in order to 
automatically apply this mitigation measure. For more information, 
refer to the following support technical information:

    Microsoft Support (2219475)
    Vulnerability in Help Center could allow remote code execution 
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2219475  
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2219475/en-us

*** Update: Added on July 14, 2010 *******************************
  When the security update is installed, the above mitigation measure 
  is no longer necessary.
