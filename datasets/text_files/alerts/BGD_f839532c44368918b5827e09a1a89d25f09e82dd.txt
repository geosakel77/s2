Please note that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc 2.25 and earlier. Impact : An attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. GNU glibc 2.25 and prior versions are vulnerable. Mitigation : Updates are available. Please check specific vendor advisory for more information.
