products, the most severe of which could allow for code execution. There
are reports of a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-8174)
being actively exploited in the wild as part of a cyber-espionage campaign. Impact : Successful exploitation of the most severe of these
vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges
as the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the
user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete
data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts
are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less
impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
