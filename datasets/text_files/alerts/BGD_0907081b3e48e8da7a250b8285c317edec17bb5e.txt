These vulnerabilities are as follows: * One use after free vulnerability that could allow for remote code execution (CVE-2018-4919). * One type confusion vulnerability that could allow for remote code execution (CVE-2018-4920) Impact : Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in the attacker gaining control of the affected system. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. System Affected: * Adobe Flash Player Desktop Runtime for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux versions 28.0.0.161 and earlier * Adobe Flash Player for Google Chrome versions 28.0.0.161 and earlier * Adobe Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 versions 28.0.0.161 and earlier Mitigation : The following actions are recommended: Install the update once it has been released by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. Remind users not to visit websites or follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
