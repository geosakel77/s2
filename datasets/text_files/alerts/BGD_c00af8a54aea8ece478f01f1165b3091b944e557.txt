The problem is that the invocation of the mail() function will cause PHP to execute the sendmail program. The fifth argument allows to pass arguments to this execution which allows a configuration of sendmail . Since sendmail offers the –X option to log all mail traffic in a file, an attacker can abuse this option and spawn a malicious PHP file in the webroot directory of the attacked server. Impact: A malicious user can remotely execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system simply by writing an email in Roundcube 1.2.2 (>= 1.0). Mitigation: Vendor has released patch version.
