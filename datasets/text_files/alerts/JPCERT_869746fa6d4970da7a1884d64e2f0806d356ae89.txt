             Vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2011/at110034.txt


I. Overview

  Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Adobe Acrobat Reader, a PDF file 
viewing software, and Adobe Acrobat, a PDF file creation and 
conversion software. As a result, a remote attacker could terminate 
Adobe Reader and Acrobat or execute arbitrary code by convincing a 
user to open a specially crafted PDF file. Adobe Systems has already 
observed targeted attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. 
  Users are recommended to update to the corrected software provided 
by Adobe Systems.
  For Adobe Reader/Acrobat X, which mitigates the problem through its 
protection function, a fix will be provided with the next regular 
security update (on January 10, 2012, local time).

  The security updates also contain a fix to the vulnerability of 
Adobe Flash Player that was fixed with APSB11-28. For more information, 
refer to the following website:

    http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb11-28.html


II. Products Affected

  Affected products and versions are as follows:

  - Adobe Reader X (10.1.1) and earlier
  - Adobe Reader 9.4.6 and earlier
  - Adobe Acrobat X (10.1.1) and earlier
  - Adobe Acrobat 9.4.6 and earlier

For more information, refer to Adobe Systems' website.


III. Solution

  For Adobe Reader/Acrobat 9.4.6 or earlier versions, apply the fixed 
software provided by Adobe Systems. Adobe Reader and Acrobat will be 
updated by starting the products, selecting the menu Help (H), and 
then clicking Check for Updates (U).

  If update is not possible, download the latest Adobe Reader and 
Acrobat from the following URL:

    Adobe.com - New downloads
    http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/new.jsp

  Users using Adobe Reader/Acrobat X (10.1.1) or earlier should refer 
to the workaround described in APSA11-04 and confirm that the 
protection function is enabled.

    http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa11-04.html

  For more information, refer to Adobe Systems' website.

  Many of the targeted attacks that have occurred recently have 
exploited known vulnerabilities, and most damage could have been 
prevented by applying security updates. Since these vulnerabilities 
are also being exploited in some targeted attacks, security updates 
should be applied as soon as possible.
