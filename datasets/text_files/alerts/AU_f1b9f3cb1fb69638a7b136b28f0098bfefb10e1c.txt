The APT group has exploited the same Microsoft Exchange vulnerability in Australia. Alert status CRITICAL Background / What has happened? The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have observed an Iranian government-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group exploit Fortinet vulnerabilities since at least March 2021, and a Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability since at least October 2021 to gain access to systems in advance of follow-on operations, which include deploying ransomware. ACSC is also aware this APT group has used the same Microsoft Exchange vulnerability in Australia. The Iranian government-sponsored APT actors are actively targeting a broad range of victims across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the Transportation Sector and the Healthcare and Public Health Sector, as well as Australian organizations. FBI, CISA, and ACSC assess the actors are focused on exploiting known vulnerabilities rather than targeting specific sectors. These Iranian government-sponsored APT actors can leverage this access for follow-on operations, such as data exfiltration or encryption, ransomware, and extortion. Mitigation / How do I stay secure? The FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC have published an advisory that provides observed tactics and techniques, as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs). The FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of the advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from Iranian government-sponsored cyber actors. Assistance / Where can I go for help? ACSC can provide tailored cyber security advice and assistance, reporting, and incident response support at via 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER1). 17 Nov 2021 Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities Content written for Individuals & families Small & medium businesses Organisations & critical infrastructure Government View all content First published: 17 Nov 2021 Last updated: 17 Nov 2021 Share on Was this information helpful?
