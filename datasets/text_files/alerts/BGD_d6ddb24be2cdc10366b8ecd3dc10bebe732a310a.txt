Mozilla Firefox is a web browser that is used to access the Internet. Mozilla Firefox ESR is a version of the web browser intended to be deployed in large organizations. Mozilla Thunderbird is an email client. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox/Firefox ESR/Thunderbird, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * Internal network hosts probing vulnerability exist when slipstream techniques and malicious webpage are combined. (CVE-2021-23961) * A memory corruption and out of bounds write vulnerability exist when WebGL framebuffer is not initialized early enough. (CVE-2021-23994) * An arbitrary code execution vulnerability exist when Responsive Design Mode is enabled. (CVE-2021-23995) * Content outside webpage viewport vulnerability exist when 3D CSS and Javascript are combined. (CVE-2021-23996) * Arbitrary code execution  vulnerability exist when using font cache. (CVE-2021-23997) * A spoofing vulnerability exist when an HTTP page could have inherited a secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. (CVE-2021-23998) * A privilege-escalation vulnerability exist when a Blob url is loaded through some unusual user interaction or by privileged user. (CVE-2021-23999) * An information disclosure vulnerability exist when requestPointerLock() is applied to the incorrect tab. (CVE-2021-24000) * Session history manipulation vulnerability exist when infrastructure is not restricted to testing-only configurations. (CVE-2021-24001) * A command-execution vulnerability exist when clicked on a FTP url containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D). (CVE-2021-24002) * HTML injection vulnerability exist with no Content Security Policy (CVE-2021-29944) * A denial-of-service vulnerability exist when WebAssembly JIT miscalculates the size of a return type. (CVE-2021-29945) * A security-bypass vulnerability exist when it bypasses port blocking restrictions when used in the Alt-Svc header. (CVE-2021-29946) * Memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2021-29947) * A race condition vulnerability exist when reading from disk while verifying signatures (CVE-2021-29948) Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 87.0 * Mozilla Firefox ESR versions prior to 78.9 * Mozilla Thunderbird versions prior to 78.7 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Mozilla to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services REFERENCES: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-14/ https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-15/ https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-16/ https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23961 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-23994 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-23995 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-23996 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-23997 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-23998 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-23999 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24000 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24001 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24002 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29944 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29945 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29946 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29947 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29948 Share Recommended Posts ABOUT “BLUEBLEED”SERVICE AND THE VULNERABILITY OF MICROSOFT AWS SERVERS 20 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
