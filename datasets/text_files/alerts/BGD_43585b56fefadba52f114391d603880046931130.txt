Confluence is a wiki tool used to help teams collaborate and share knowledge efficiently. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance. Depending on the privileges associated with the instance, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. IMPACT: US Cyber Command has reported mass exploitation of CVE-2021-26084 and anticipates accelerated attack volume. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Confluence Server and Data Center all versions prior to 6.13.23 * Confluence Server and Data Center versions from 6.14.0 prior to 7.4.11 * Confluence Server and Data Center versions from 7.5.0 prior to 7.11.6 * Confluence Server and Data Center versions 7.12.x prior to 7.12.5 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Atlassian to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a nonprivileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Evaluate read, write, and execute permissions on all newly installed software. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
