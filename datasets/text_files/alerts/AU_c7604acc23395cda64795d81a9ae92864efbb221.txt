Alert status HIGH Background / What has happened? The ACSC is tracking three vulnerabilities ( CVE-2021-34473 , CVE-2021-34523 , CVE-2021-31207 known collectively as ProxyShell) in Microsoft Exchange Servers that allow for unauthenticated remote code execution and arbitrary file upload with elevated privileges. It is likely that threat actors will actively exploit these vulnerabilities against vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Servers. CVE-2021-34473 provides a mechanism for pre-authentication remote code execution, enabling malicious actors to remotely execute code on an affected system. CVE-2021-34523 enables malicious actors to execute arbitrary code post-authentication on Microsoft Exchange servers due to a flaw in the PowerShell service not properly validating access tokens. CVE-2021-31207 enables post-authentication malicious actors to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM and write arbitrary files. Microsoft released patches to these vulnerabilities in April and May 2021.
