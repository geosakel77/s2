       Alert Regarding Vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 (S2-048)

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2017/at170025.html


I. Overview
On July 7, 2017 (US time), Apache Software Foundation released the
information (S2-048) about a vulnerability of Apache Struts 2
(CVE-2017-9791). If input values are not properly processed in the
Struts application using Struts 1 Plugin in 2.3 series of Apache
Struts 2, the system is affected by this vulnerability. When this
vulnerability is exploited, remote attackers may be able to execute
arbitrary code on the server running Apache Struts 2.

For more details on the vulnerability, please refer to the information
provided by Apache Software Foundation.

    Apache Struts 2 Documentation
    S2-048 : Possible RCE in the Struts Showcase app in the Struts 1 plugin example in Struts 2.3.x series
    https://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-048.html

In addition, it is pointed out that the Struts application included in
showcase, which is a sample application of 2.3 series of Apache Struts 2,
is affected by this vulnerability. The proof of concept of this
vulnerability is already in the wild, and through testing, JPCERT/CC
confirmed that arbitrary code can be remotely executed on a server
using Apache Struts 2 (2.3.32).

If you are using the affected version of Apache Struts 2 and also
running the Struts application using the Struts 1 Plugin, we recommend
correcting the process of input values appropriately by referring to
"III. Workaround".


II. Affected Systems
The following versions are affected by this vulnerability:

  - Apache Struts 2
    - versions 2.3.x

This vulnerability may be affected if Struts application is using
Struts 1 Plugin. For more details on this vulnerability on Struts
application, please refer to the information from Struts application
developer.


III. Workaround
Apache Software Foundation has released the following workaround to
handle input values appropriately.

** Update: July 11, 2017 Update *************************************
As a method to modify the Struts application in showcase, the usage
of resource key in the process of using ActionMessage class is shown
as a workaround.

* Example of workaround for sample Struts application in showcase
   (before applying)
    messages.add("msg", new ActionMessage("Gangster " + gform.getName() + " added successfully"))
   (after applying)
    messages.add("msg", new ActionMessage("struts1.gangsterAdded", gform.getName()));
*********************************************************************

JPCERT/CC has confirmed that by applying this workaround, proof of
concept will not be exploited against this vulnerability. 
If it is difficult to apply the workaround, please consider restricting
access from the Internet, and consider taking measures such as using
WAF (Web Application Firewall).
