According to a new analysis published by Intezer,come to confirm that despite a period of inactivity in regards to code changes, the Stantinko botnet continues to operate even today. Intezer identified a new version of this Linux trojan masqueraded as httpd. httpd is Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol Server, a commonly used program on Linux servers. The sample’s version is 2.17, and the older version is 1.2. This Linux version acted as a SOCKS5 proxy, with Stantinko turning infected Linux systems into nodes into a larger proxy network. Each of these Linux systems would be used to launch brute-force attacks against content management systems (CMSs) and various web-based systems, such as databases. Once it compromised these systems, the Stantinko gang would elevate its access to the underlying server OS (Linux or Windows) and then deployed a copy of itself and a crypto-miner to generate even more profits for the malware authors. Upon execution, the malware will validate a configuration file which is delivered together with the malware on the infected machine. The malware expects the configuration file to be located at “/etc/pd.d/proxy.conf”. If the configuration file does not exist, or if it lacks the required structure, the malware exits without conducting any additional malicious activity.
