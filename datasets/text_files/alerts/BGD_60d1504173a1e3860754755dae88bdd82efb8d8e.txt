The flaw can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker on the same network, in order to gain escalated privileges. The issue (CVE-2020-8758), found internally by Intel employees, ranks 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, making it critical severity, according to Intel in a Tuesday security advisory. IMPACT he flaw stems from improper buffer restrictions in a third party component network subsystem within Intel AMT (and Intel’s Standard Manageability solution, ISM, which has a similar function as AMT). One important factor that impacts how difficult the flaw is to exploit is whether or not AMT is “provisioned.” In order to use AMT, systems must go through a process called “provisioning.” This process is used to connect the computer to a remote computer used to manage it (for instance, inserting a specially formatted USB drive). If AMT is provisioned, it may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via network access. However, an attacker would need to be authenticated and have local access to exploit the flaw if the AMT system is unprovisioned (if the system is unprovisioned, the flaw also has a lower CVSS score of 7.8 out of 10). SYSTEM AFFECTED Intel AMT and Intel ISM versions before 11.8.79, 11.12.79, 11.22.79, 12.0.68 and 14.0.39. RECOMMENDATIONS Following actions are recommended to be taken: Intel recommends that users of Intel AMT and Intel ISM update to the latest version provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues, REFERENCES https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8758 https://threatpost.com/critical-intel-active-management-technology-flaw-allows-privilege-escalation/159036/ Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
