Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Adobe Dimension * Uncontrolled Search Path Element, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28595) Adobe Illustrator * Out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28591, CVE-2021-28592) * Use After Free vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system read. (CVE-2021-28593) Adobe Framemaker * Out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28596) Acrobat and Reader * Path Traversal vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system read. (CVE-2021-35980, CVE-2021-28644) * Use After Free vulnerabilities, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28640, CVE-2021-28641, CVE-2021-28639, CVE-2021-35983, CVE-2021-35981, CVE-2021-28635) * Type Confusion vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. ( CVE-2021-28643) * Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system write. (CVE-2021-28642) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for a memory leak. (CVE-2021-28637) * Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28638) * Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28636) * OS Command Injection vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28634) * Out-of-bounds Read, vulnerability, which could allow for privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-35988, CVE-2021-35987) * Type Confusion vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system read. (CVE-2021-35986) * NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability, which could allow for application denial-of-service. (CVE-2021-35985, CVE-2021-35984) Adobe Bridge * Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28624) * Improper Input Validation vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-35991) * Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-35989, CVE-2021-35990) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system read. (CVE-2021-35992) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Adobe Dimension 3.4 and earlier versions * Adobe Illustrator 2021 25.2.3  and earlier versions * Adobe Framemaker 2019 Update 8 and earlier * Adobe Framemaker 2020 Release Update 1 and earlier * Acrobat DC 2021.005.20054 and earlier versions * Acrobat Reader DC 2021.005.20054 and earlier versions * Acrobat 2020 2020.004.30005 and earlier versions * Acrobat Reader 2020 2020.004.30005 and earlier versions * Acrobat 2017 2017.011.30197  and earlier versions * Acrobat Reader 2017 2017.011.30197  and earlier versions * Adobe Bridge  11.0.2 and earlier versions RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
