Impact: Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in denial-of-service conditions. Mitigation: As per Trend Micro Blog information (Reference URLs are listed below), IIS 6.0 was included with Windows Server 2003; unfortunately, Microsoft isn’t supporting and won’t be patching the old OS version anymore. To mitigate the risk, disabling the WebDAV service on the vulnerable IIS 6.0 installation is recommended. Newer versions of Windows Server shipped with newer versions of IIS are not affected by this vulnerability.
