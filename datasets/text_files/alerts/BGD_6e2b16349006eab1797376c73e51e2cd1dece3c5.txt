The Cisco HyperFlex HX Series is Cisco’s a converged infrastructure system that integrates computing, networking and storage resources to increase efficiency and enable centralized management. This product contains a web-based interface which allows user can access to manage the device. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities within the web interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Cisco HyperFlex HX software, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * A vulnerability in the web-based management interface could allow for arbitrary code execution on the affected device due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device as the root user. (CVE-2021-1497). * A vulnerability in the web-based management interface could allow for arbitrary code execution on the affected device due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device as the tomcat8 user. (CVE-2021-1498). Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Cisco HyperFlex HX Release earlier than 4.0, and 4.0 prior to 4.0(2e) * Cisco HyperFlex HX Release 4.5 prior to 4.5(1b) RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the update provided by Cisco immediately after appropriate testing. * Restrict access to the management web interface from authorized hosts. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
