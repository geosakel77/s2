The  vulnerability exists in the AJP protocol, which is by default exposed  over TCP port 8009 and enabled. The vulnerability can be exploited by an  attacker who can communicate with the affected AJP protocol service. If  the server is running a web application that allows for file uploads, a  remote file inclusion vulnerability becomes exploitable, that could  allow for remote code execution. Impact : Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an  attacker to read arbitrary files on the affected server. Depending on  the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could  install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts  with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have  fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of  these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured  with administrative rights. System Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.x versions less than 9.0.31 Apache Tomcat 8.x versions less than 8.5.51 Apache Tomcat 7.x versions less than 7.0.100 Apache Tomcat 6.x versions (End of life, not patched) Mitigation :  The following actions are recommended: Apply the patches provided by Apache after appropriate testing. If the AJP service is not required, disable it on the host. If the AJP service does not need to be publicly accessible, ensure  that access is filtered. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative  privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
