Description Adobe Security Bulletin APSB09-07 describes several memory-corruption vulnerabilities that affect Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Some of these vulnerabilities occur when Adobe Reader and Acrobat handle files with specially crafted JBIG2 streams. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to load a specially crafted Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Acrobat integrates with popular web browsers, and visiting a website is usually sufficient to cause Acrobat to load PDF content. Impact An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. Solution Update Adobe has released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to read Adobe Security Bulletin APSB09-07 and update vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat Disabling Javascript may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution. Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled using the Preferences menu: Open the Edit menu. Select Preferences . Choose JavaScript . Un-check Enable Acrobat JavaScript . Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents The installer for Adobe Reader and Acrobat configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to the safer option of prompting the user by importing the following as a .REG file: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AcroExch.Document.7] "EditFlags"=hex:00,00,00,00 Disable the display of PDF documents in the web browser Preventing PDF documents from opening inside a web browser will partially mitigate this vulnerability. This workaround may also mitigate future vulnerabilities. To prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a web browser, do the following: Open Adobe Acrobat Reader. Open the Edit menu. Choose the Preferences option. Choose the Internet section. Un-check the Display PDF in browser check box. Do not access PDF documents from untrusted sources Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF documents, particularly those hosted on websites or delivered as email attachments.
