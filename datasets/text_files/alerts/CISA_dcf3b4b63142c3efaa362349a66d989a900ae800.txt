A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been detected in exploits in the wild. The vulnerability affects the following appliances: Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 10.5 – all supported builds before 10.5.70.12 Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 11.1 – all supported builds before 11.1.63.15 Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.0 – all supported builds before 12.0.63.13 Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.1 – all supported builds before 12.1.55.18 Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway version 13.0 – all supported builds before 13.0.47.24 Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliance models 4000-WO, 4100-WO, 5000-WO, and 5100-WO – all supported software release builds before 10.2.6b and 11.0.3b. (Citrix SD-WAN WANOP is vulnerable because it packages Citrix ADC as a load balancer). Detection Measures Citrix and FireEye Mandiant released an IOC scanning tool for CVE-2019-19781 on January 22, 2020. The tool aids customers with detecting potential IOCs based on known attacks and exploits. [13] See the National Security Agency’s Cybersecurity Advisory on CVE-2019-19781 for other detection measures. [14] CISA released a utility that enables users and administrators to detect whether their Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway firmware is susceptible to CVE-2019-19781. [15] CISA encourages administrators to visit CISA’s GitHub page to download and run the tool. Mitigations CISA strongly recommends users and administrators update Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP as soon as possible. The fixed builds can be downloaded from Citrix Downloads pages for Citrix ADC , Citrix Gateway , and Citrix SD-WAN . Until the appropriate update is implemented, users and administrators should apply Citrix’s interim mitigation steps for CVE-2019-19781. [16] Verify the successful application of the above mitigations by using the tool in CTX269180 – CVE-2019-19781 – Verification ToolTest . Note: these mitigation steps apply to Citrix ADC and SD-WAN WANOP deployments. [17] Refer to table 1 for Citrix’s fix schedule. [18] Table 1.
