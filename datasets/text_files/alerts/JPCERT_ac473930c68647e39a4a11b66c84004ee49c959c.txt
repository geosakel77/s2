 Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in ISC BIND 9 (CVE-2012-5166)

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2012/at120033.html


I. Overview

  ISC BIND 9 has a vulnerability that may cause a denial of service
(DoS). If specific combinations of RDATA are loaded into a name
server, either via cache or an authoritative zone, a subsequent query
for a related record will cause named to lock up.

  According to the advisory of Internet Systems Consortium (ISC),
attacks exploiting this vulnerability have not been confirmed;
however, please apply the updated version by referring to the solution
shown in III since many DNS servers using ISC BIND 9
(i.e. authoritative DNS servers and cache DNS servers) are affected.
