Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to upload files to the vulnerable server to facilitate further compromise. Alert status HIGH Details Telerik offers a variety of products which are used to provide functionality used by web pages. In some cases, Telerik products may be installed as a third party component through other products, and as such, may be unknowingly in use. In 2017, a security vulnerability was published that affects some Telerik products which could allow a malicious cyber actor to gain control over a server. This vulnerability is detailed in CVE-2017-9248, and similarly in CVE-2017-11317 and CVE-2017-11357. Vulnerable versions of Telerik are those published between 2007 and 2017. Telerik issued a patch for these vulnerabilities in 2017, however due to the nature of the software, the patches may need to be manually applied. The tools to exploit this vulnerability have been publicly published and require only basic knowledge or skills to use successfully. Any servers currently running a vulnerable version should be considered at risk and remediation steps should be taken. 22 May 2020 Advisory 2020-004: Remote code execution vulnerability being actively exploited in vulnerable versions of Telerik UI by sophisticated actors 16 May 2019 2019-126: Recommendations for mitigation of vulnerable version of Telerik UI Content written for Individuals & families Small & medium businesses Organisations & critical infrastructure Government View all content First published: 16 May 2019 Last updated: 22 May 2020 Share on Was this information helpful?
