SAP is a software company which creates software to manage business operations and customer relations. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute code on the affected systems. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Applications configured to have fewer restrictions on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with elevated privileges. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SAP products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Source Rules that affects SAP Commerce (CVE-2021-27602) * Improper Authentication in SAP NetWeaver ABAP Server and ABAP Platform (CVE-2021-27610) * Missing XML Validation in SAP NetWeaver AS for JAVA (CVE-2021-27635) * Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in SAP NetWeaver ABAP Server and ABAP Platform (CVE-2021-27606, CVE-2021-27629, CVE-2021-27630, CVE-2021-27631, CVE-2021-27632, CVE-2021-27597, CVE-2021-27633, CVE-2021-27634, CVE-2021-27607, CVE-2021-27628) * Information Disclosure vulnerability in SAP Business One (CVE-2021-33662) * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP Manufacturing Execution (CVE-2021-27615) * Missing Authorization check in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP and ABAP Platform (CVE-2021-21473) * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP Netweaver AS for ABAP (Web Survey) (CVE-2021-21490) * Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in SAP IGS (CVE-2021-27620, CVE-2021-27622, CVE-2021-27623, CVE-2021-27624, CVE-2021-27625, CVE-2021-27626, CVE-2021-27627) * Information Disclosure in SAP Enable Now (SAP Workforce Performance Builder – Manager) (CVE-2021-27637) * Plaintext command injection in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP (CVE-2021-33663) * Information Disclosure in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (UserAdmin Application) (CVE-2021-27621) * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP (Applications based on Web Dynpro ABAP) (CVE-2021-33664) * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP (Applications based on SAP GUI for HTML) (CVE-2021-33665) * MIME Sniffing Vulnerability in SAP Commerce Cloud (CVE-2021-33666) * Multiple improper input validation vulnerabilities in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer (CVE-2021-27638, CVE-2021-27639, CVE-2021-27640, CVE-2021-33659, CVE-2021-27642, CVE-2021-33661, CVE-2021-27641, CVE-2021-27643, CVE-2021-33660) * Missing Authorization check in HCM Travel Management Fiori Apps V2 (CVE-2021-27605) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code on the affected systems.
