This vulnerability exists due to the way Duplicator       handles certain requests from unauthenticated users. When an       attacker sends a specially crafted request to Duplicator, an       unauthenticated user can download arbitrary files from the target       WordPress site. This includes the ‘wp-config.php’ file, which       contains various site configurations, and potentially database       credentials. Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for Arbitrary File Downloads. System Affected: * WordPress Duplicator Plugin prior to 1.3.28 Mitigation: The following actions are recommended: * Apply appropriate updates provided for Duplicator to affected       systems, immediately after appropriate testing. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and       services. * Verify no unauthorized system modifications have occurred on       system before applying patch. * Monitor intrusion detection systems for any signs of anomalous       activity. * Unless required, limit external network access to affected       products.
