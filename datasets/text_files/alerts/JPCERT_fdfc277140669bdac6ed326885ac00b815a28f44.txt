used for web applications. Through exploitation of vulnerabilities in
web applications or software used for web applications, various kinds of
damages may occur, including website compromise.

  Joomla!, an open source CMS, contains a vulnerability*2 executing
arbitrary code, which originates in a PHP vulnerability*1. JPCERT/CC

    application (CMS, etc.) is the latest available version
  - Periodically check web server access logs and for any suspicious
    requests

    website contents or any content alterations
  - Perform a third-party security assessment on the website to check
    for any vulnerabilities in the website
