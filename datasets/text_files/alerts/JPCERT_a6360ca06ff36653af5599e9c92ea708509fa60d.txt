    verification environment with JRE 6 update 19 installed, 
    JPCERT/CC has confirmed that calc.exe is executed.
    (The Java logo is displayed on the browser.)

  - Verification result for JRE 6 Update 20
    As a result of executing the exploit code in the above 
    verification environment with JRE 6 update 20 installed, 
    JPCERT/CC has confirmed that calc.exe is not executed.

both may be installed. Users should check their JDK/JRE, and apply 
the corresponding corrected software.
