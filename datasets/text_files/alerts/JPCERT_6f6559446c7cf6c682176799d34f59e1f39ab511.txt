 ISC BIND 9 DoS Vulnerability of Authoritative and Recursive Servers

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2011/at110019.txt


I. Overview

  ISC BIND 9 contains a vulnerability that will cause a Denial of 
Service (DoS).
As a result, a remote attacker could easily initiate a Denial of 
Service (DoS) attack on DNS servers (authoritative DNS servers and 
cache DNS servers) running BIND 9 by sending specially crafted DNS 
packets to the servers. 

    Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (ISC)
    ISC BIND 9 Remote packet Denial of Service against Authoritative and Recursive Servers
    https://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-2464

  This vulnerability is applicable with many of the DNS servers 
(authoritative DNS servers and cache DNS servers) running BIND 9. 
This vulnerability cannot be mitigated using the access control 
features of ISC BIND 9. Therefore, temporary mitigation is difficult, 
and since attacks can be initiated based on vulnerability information 
pubished on the Internet, we recommend quickly deploying the corrected
version based on "III. Solution."

  ISC has also published vulnerability information with regard to BIND
9.8 (CVE-2011-2465). BIND 9.8 may unintentionally terminate its 
service when it is run as a cache DNS server with the RPZ feature 
enabled. For more information, refer to information from ISC.

  According to ISC, the following versions may be affected by this 
vulnerability.

    vulnerability.

  Those who are using BIND versions provided by distributors should 
refer to information provided by the distributors.


III. Solution

  ISC has released BIND versions that correct this vulnerability. 
Additionally, corrected versions are also being provided by several 
distributors. We recommend quickly deploying the corrected version 
after thorough testing.
