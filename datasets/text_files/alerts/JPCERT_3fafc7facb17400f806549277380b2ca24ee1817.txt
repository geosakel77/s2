  * Even if you use a web browser other than Internet Explorer, there

IV. Workaround
As a temporary countermeasure until security updates can be applied,
please consider the following workaround such as disabling Flash on
the browser or restricting Flash display to mitigate impacts of the
vulnerability. In addition, applying these countermeasures may affect
other applications. Please carefully consider and test any side effects
prior to applying any of the workaround.

  - Limit the Flash content
    Please disable Flash on your browser or enable Click-to-Play
    features.
    For Microsoft Edge, it is recommended to disable Flash on the
    browser as a workaround. For more information, please refer
    to "V. References". 

  - Open the security tab on "Internet Options" in Internet Explorer
    and change the security level to "High" for the Internet zone and
    local intranet zone.
