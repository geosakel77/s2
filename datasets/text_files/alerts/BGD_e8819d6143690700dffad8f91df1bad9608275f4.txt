Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: Adobe Connect * Improper Access Control vulnerability, which could allow for privilege escalation (CVE-2021-28579) Adobe Acrobat and Reader * Out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which could allow arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28554, CVE-2021-28551) * Use After Free vulnerabilities, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28552, CVE-2021-28631, CVE-2021-28632) Adobe Photoshop * Heap-based Buffer Overflow, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28624) * Buffer Overflow, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28582) Adobe Experience Manager * Cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28625) * Improper Authorization vulnerability, which could allow for application denial-of-service. (CVE-2021-28626) * Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, which could allow for security feature bypass. (CVE-2021-28627) * Cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28628) Adobe Creative Cloud * Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Incorrect Permissions vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system write. (CVE-2021-28633) * Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28594) Adobe RoboHelp * Path Traversal vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-28588) Adobe Photoshop Elements * Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Incorrect Permissions vulnerability, which could allow for privilege escalation (CVE-2021-28597) Adobe Premiere Elements * Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Incorrect Permissions vulnerability, which could allow for privilege escalation (CVE-2021-28623) Adobe After Effects * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for memory leak (CVE-2021-28600) * NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability, which could allow for application denial-of-service (CVE-2021-28601) * Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-28602, CVE-2021-28605, CVE-2021-28607) * Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-28603, CVE-2021-28604, CVE-2021-28608, CVE-2021-28610) * Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-28606) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system read (CVE-2021-28609, CVE-2021-28615) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for memory leak (CVE-2021-28611, CVE-2021-28612, CVE-2021-28614, CVE-2021-28616) Adobe Animate * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary file system read (CVE-2021-28630) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for memory leak (CVE-2021-28619) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for information disclosure (CVE-2021-28617, CVE-2021-28618) * Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-28621) * Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-28620, CVE-2021-28629) * Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability, which could allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-28622) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * Adobe Connect 11.2.1 and earlier versions * Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC version 2021.001.20155 and earlier * Acrobat 2020 and Acrobat Reader 2020 version 2020.001.30025 and earlier * Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 version 2017.011.30196  and earlier * Photoshop 2020 21.2.8 and earlier versions * Photoshop 2021 22.4.1 and earlier versions * Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.5.8.0 and earlier versions * Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Cloud Services * Creative Cloud Desktop Application (Installer) 2.4 and earlier version * RoboHelp Server 2019.0.9 and earlier versions * Photoshop Elements (installer) 5.2 and earlier versions * Adobe Premiere Elements (installer) 5.2 and earlier versions * Adobe After Effects 18.2 and earlier versions * Adobe Animate 21.0.6  and earlier versions RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
