         Critical Patch Update for Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2011/at110015.txt


I. Overview

  Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE contain multiple vulnerabilities. A 
remote attacker could use these vulnerabilities and execute arbitrary 
code. For more information about the vulnerabilities, refer to 
information from Oracle.

II. Products Affected

  Affected products and versions are as follows:

   - Java SE JDK and JRE 6 Update 25 and earlier

  * The JRE is preinstalled in some PCs provided by certain 
    manufacturers. Just in case, check whether JRE is installed on the
    PC.


III. Solution

  Oracle has released corrected sofware. Update the software to the 
corrected software.

    - Java SE 6 Update 26

    Java SE Downloads
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

  When 64-bit Windows is used, either 32-bit JDK/JRE or 64-bit JDK/JRE,
or both may be installed. Users should check their JDK/JRE, and apply 
the corresponding corrected software.

  The Java version number installed on your PC can be verified through
the following page: Note that if both 32-bit and 63-bit Java are 
installed, check the version number using a 32-bit and 64-bit browser 
respectively. (If Java is not installed on your system, this web site 
may prompt you to install it. If you do not wish to install Java, you 
may safely ignore this.)

  * When upgrading to the latest version of Java, other software 
    relying on Java may be affected. Please keep this in mind when 
    upgrading.
