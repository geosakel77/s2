When running on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server. When using a VirtualDirContext it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs for resources served by the VirtualDirContext using a specially crafted request. Impact : Exploitation of one of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to take control of an affected server. Mitigation : Updates are available. Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.81 or later. Please check specific vendor advisory for more information.
