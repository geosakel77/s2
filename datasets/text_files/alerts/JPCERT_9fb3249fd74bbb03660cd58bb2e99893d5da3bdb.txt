Gumblar-related drive-by-download attacks
                                       infecting PCs with DDoS clients

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2010/at100011.txt


I. Overview

  Since last year, JPCERT/CC has been receiving reports on website 
alteration caused by so-called Gumblar viruses. When a user views a 
site altered by a series of attacks, the user's PC may get infected 
with multiple malware. Among the infectious malware, JPCERT/CC has 
found the one that executes a DDos attack is newly added.
  If the PC is infected with this malware, it could execute a DDos 
attack against companies or organizations inside and outside of Japan.


II. Solution

  If a user views an altered site on the PC where vulnerable software 
is installed, malware infects the user's PC by exploiting the 
multiple software vulnerabilities. Currently known software products 
targeted by the attack are as follows:

   - Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader
   - Adobe Flash Player
   - Java (JRE)
   - Microsoft Windows

As far as JPCERT/CC has confirmed, exploited vulnerabilities of the 
above software have already been fixed. Therefore, malware infection 
can be prevented by applying the corresponding corrected software to 
each product.

When the PC is infected with malware, the following may happen: fake 
security software is activated; the Java startup screen is 
unintentionally displayed; the PC becomes unstable, etc. If infection 
is suspected, disconnect the PC from the network, and take necessary 
measures.
