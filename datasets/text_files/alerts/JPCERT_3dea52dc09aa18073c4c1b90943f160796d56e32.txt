                 Vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 (S2-045)

          https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2017/at170009.html


I. Overview

  Apache Struts 2 provided by the Apache Software Foundation contains a
vulnerability (S2-045/CVE-2017-5638). A remote attacker sending a
specially crafted HTTP request leveraging the vulnerability may execute
arbitrary code on the server that runs an application using Apache Struts 2
(Struts application). For more details on the vulnerability, please
refer to the information provided by the Apache Software Foundation.

  Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for this vulnerability has been already
made public, and JPCERT/CC's test of this code confirmed that arbitrary 
code was executed with the execution privilege of the application server
which runs the Struts application. 

  This vulnerability originates in the processing of Jakarta Multipart
parser *1) used as default in Struts 2, and JPCERT/CC observed that
Apache Struts 2 is affected by this vulnerability if the parser is not
changed from the default setting in Struts configuration file
(e.g. struts.xml).

*1) Jakarta Multipart parser
    Jakarta Multipart parser is a parser programmed to process
    multipart/form-data format requests. This parser is used under the
    default settings.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/File+Upload#FileUpload-AlternateLibraries

  Apache Software Foundation has provided versions of the software that
address the vulnerability. For those using an affected version of the
software, it is strongly recommended to quickly resolve the issue based
on information provided in "V. Solution".

** Update: Mar 17, 2017 Update ***************************************
  JPCERT/CC has been receiving reports on the attacks which seem to
exploit the vulnerability. If you are using any of the affected
versions of the software on the servers running Struts Application,
please implement the countermeasures described in "V. Solution".
**********************************************************************

** Update: Mar 21, 2017 Update ***************************************
  Apache Software Foundation has released a Security Bulletin (S2-046)
related to the vulnerability. The CVE Identifier (CVE-2017-5638) is
the same as the Security Bulletin (S2-045) which was already released
before, and there is no further update to the software version which
was introduced in the previous advisory.
  The new advisory introduces two plugins for fixing Jakarta Multipart
parser/JakartaStreamMultiPartRequest as additional workarounds.

    Possible RCE when performing file upload based on Jakarta Multipart parser (similar to S2-045)

**********************************************************************


II. A Possible Attack Scenario

  Sending a specially crafted HTTP request leveraging the vulnerability
to a Struts application may result in arbitrary code
execution on the server which runs the Struts application.


III. Affected Systems

  The following versions are affected by this vulnerability:

  - Apache Struts versions 2.3.5 through 2.3.31
  - Apache Struts versions 2.5 through 2.5.10


IV. Test Results from JPCERT/CC

  JPCERT/CC tested the PoC code that leverages this vulnerability.

  [Test content]
  - Deploy a sample application that uses Apache Struts 2 on
    Apache Tomcat. We examined if arbitrary code is executed by
    sending a specially crafted HTTP request using the proof-of-concept
    code.

  [Test Environment]
  - CentOS 7.1
  - Apache Tomcat 8.5.11
  - Java 1.8.0_121

  [Test Results] 
  - We observed that arbitrary code execution is possible on a server
    that uses the affected versions of Apache Struts 2.
  - We observed that arbitrary code is not executed on a server that
    uses the versions of Apache Struts 2 where the vulnerability has
    been addressed.
  - We observed that arbitrary code is not executed on a server when
    the default parser has been switched from Jakarta Multipart parser
    to Jakarta StreamMultiPartRequest.

    - Apache Struts 2.3.31                   |   affected   |
    - Apache Struts 2.3.31(changed parser)   | not affected |
    - Apache Struts 2.3.32                   | not affected |
    - Apache Struts 2.5.10                   |   affected   |
    - Apache Struts 2.5.10.1                 | not affected |

  In addition, JPCERT/CC observed that arbitrary code is not executed
on a server if malicious requests are restricted using servlet filter *2).

*2) Function for preprocessing of requests to Web application (servlet). (Japanese)

V. Solution

  Apache Software Foundation has released a version addressing this
vulnerability. It is recommended to update to this latest version
after thorough testing.
  
  - Apache Struts 2.3.32
  - Apache Struts 2.5.10.1

  According to Apache Software Foundation, switching the default
parser from Jakarta Multipart parser to JakartaMurtiPartRequest is
also recommended as a countermeasure. If it is difficult to update
the software immediately, please consider applying the solution.
  Other available parsers include JakartaStreamMultiPartRequest, which
is programmed by default in Struts 2.3.18 and greater, and Pell
Multipart Plugin as an additional plugin, which can be configured by
setting the parameter "struts.multipart.parser" in Struts configuration
files (e.g. struts.xml).

  For details about configuration procedures, please refer to the
information below.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/File+Upload#FileUpload-AlternateLibraries

** Update: Mar 17, 2017 Update ***************************************
  JPCERT/CC was informed that JakartaStreamMultiPartRequest, recommended
as an alternative for Jakarta Multipart parser, is also affected by
this vulnerability and may be leveraged for attacks. 
  JPCERT/CC confirmed that attacks can be still launched under the
environment with the affected version of software, even after switching
the parser to JakartaStreamMultiPartRequest. JPCERT/CC strongly
recommends updating the software to the latest version as soon as
possible.

  In addition, Apache Software Foundation has announced that disabling
File Upload Interceptor is another workaround. This will only work for
Struts 2.5.8 - 2.5.10. Please conduct sufficient verification before
applying the workaround.

**********************************************************************

** Update: Mar 21, 2017 Update ***************************************
  The CVE Identifier (CVE-2017-5638) of the vulnerability specified in
the Security Bulletin (S2-046) is the same as Security Bulletin (S2-045)
which was already released before, and there is no further update to
the software version which was introduced in the previous advisory.
However, two plugins for fixing Jakarta Multipart parser/
JakartaStreamMultiPartRequest as additional workarounds. For more
details, please refer to the information from Apache Software Foundation.
