 Alert Regarding Re-emergence of Emotet Malware Infection Activities

       https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2022/at220006.html


I. Overview
JPCERT/CC has received many reports regarding the infection of the
malware Emotet, which has been confirmed to resume its activities
since the late November 2021. The number of reports has increased in
particular since the first week of February 2022.

The number of .jp email addresses that may be infected with Emotet and
abused in malspam activities has significantly increased. Since the
Emotet activity is almost as severe as 2020 when Emotet infections
were very active, JPCERT/CC recommends checking whether appropriate
measures are taken against Emotet.

II. Observed Emotet features and trends
Emotet that has been observed since the late November 2021 is mainly
distributed through emails as an Excel or Word file with macros (or as
a password protected Zip file containing such file). Enabling the
macro after opening the file leads to the infection of Emotet.

In addition to these methods, JPCERT/CC has also observed cases where
malicious Excel and Word files are downloaded by clicking a link in the
body of an email, or Emotet infection through a link that is pretending
to be for installing an application on Windows.

The body of the email and the attached file contain the content that
prompts users to open the attached file and enable content or macro.
The following is a sample email confirmed by JPCERT/CC.

** Update: April 26, 2022 Update ************************************
From around April 25, 2022, emails with a shortcut file (LNK file) or
a password-protected Zip file containing the shortcut file that lead
to the Emotet infection have been observed. Executing the file
drops and executes a script file that downloads and installs Emotet.

The new method may have been introduced to infect without requiring
email recipients to enable macros or content on Microsoft Word or Excel.
*********************************************************************

It is recommended not to open the attached file or link unless it can
be trusted although the email looks to be coming from a business
partner or acquaintance.

** Update: February 15, 2022 Update *********************************
After this alert was released, we have received inquiries about
Emotet infection from multiple organizations. Cases where an email
is sent due to an Emotet infection are divided into multiple patterns
that involve the infected accounts and their stakeholders.

1) A case where your organization is infected with Emotet and a spoofed email is delivered.

When infected with Emotet, information such as email information
stored in the infected device and the name of the person in charge
registered in the address book is stolen. The stolen information can
be abused in spoofed emails that lead to Emotet infections.

[Fig. 4: Case where your organization is infected with Emotet and spoofed emails are delivered (Japanese)]

2) A case where a business partner is infected with Emotet and a spoofed email is delivered.

Just because an email impersonating an employee of your organization
is observed, it does not always mean that the employee's device is
infected with Emotet. There is a possibility that the device of a
business partner with whom the employee has exchanged emails in the
past has been infected with Emotet, and the information of the
employee that was included in the stolen information from the
business partner has been abused.

[Figure 5: A case where a business partner is infected with Emotet and a spoofed email is delivered (Japanese)]

Also, since there are cases where Emotet emails have been sent from
Japanese mail servers, JPCERT/CC recommends checking if the
infrastructure such as the mail server managed by your organization
is not being abused. If abused, the servers may have received a large
number of bounce emails, for example because Emotet emails have not
been delivered to some of the destination addresses.

[Figure 6: Case of receiving a large amount of bounce emails due to Emotet infection (Japanese)]

If an email impersonating an employee of your organization is
observed, it is recommended to confirm and check the situation
how the email was sent among the parties concerned, and take
appropriate actions by referring to the information such as
the following FAQ described later.
