Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * Multiple vulnerabilities in Framework that could allow for Escalation of Privileges (CVE-2021-0303, CVE-2021-0306, CVE-2021-0307, CVE-2021-0310, CVE-2021-0315, CVE-2021-0317, CVE-2021-0318, CVE-2021-0319) * A vulnerability in Framework that could allow for Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-15999) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Framework that could allow for Information Disclosure (CVE-2021-0304, CVE-2021-0309, CVE-2021-0321, CVE-2021-0322) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Framework that could allow for Denial of Service (CVE-2021-0313, CVE-2019-9376) * A vulnerability in Media Framework that could allow for Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-6328) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Media Framework that could allow for Information Disclosure (CVE-2021-0311, CVE-2021-0312) * Multiple vulnerabilities in System that could allow for Escalation of Privileges (CVE-2020-0471, CVE-2021-0308) * A vulnerability in System that could allow for Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-0316) * A vulnerability in System that could allow for Information Disclosure (CVE-2021-0320) * Multiple vulnerabilities in Kernel components that could allow for Information Disclosure (CVE-2020-10732, CVE-2020-10766, CVE-2021-0323) * A high severity vulnerability in MediaTek components (CVE-2021-0301) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm components (CVE-2020-11233, CVE-2020-11239, CVE-2020-11240, CVE-2020-11250, CVE-2020-11261, CVE-2020-11262) * Multiple critical severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm closed-source components (CVE-2020-11134, CVE-2020-11182) * Multiple high severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm closed-source components (CVE-2020-11126, CVE-2020-11159, CVE-2020-11181, CVE-2020-11235, CVE-2020-11238, CVE-2020-11241, CVE-2020-11260) IMPACT Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED * Android OS builds utilizing Security Patch Levels issued prior to January 5, 2021 RECOMMENDATIONS The following actions are recommended: * Apply appropriate updates by Google Android or mobile carriers to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. * Remind users to only download applications from trusted vendors in the Play Store. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources.
