               Alert Regarding Mirai Variant Infections

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2017/at170049.html


I. Overview
Since November 2017, Mirai variant infections have been observed
domestically. Devices infected with Mirai and its variants become part
of a botnet, receive commands from a remote attacker and are used to
conduct DDoS attacks.

** Update: March 12, 2018 Update *************************************
The graph legend data was corrected as 52869/tcp and 37215/tcp had
been incorrectly described in reverse in the graph legend.
**********************************************************************

Investigations by JPCERT/CC, National Institute of Information and
Communications Technology (NICT), National Policy Agency revealed that
infections were being spread through exploitation of a known vulnerability
(CVE-2014-8351). Further investigation revealed that a large number of
the infected devices included broadband routers from Logitec Corp.
Publicly available information also states that routers from Huawei (HG532)
have also been targeted.

Logitec Corp. had confirmed the issue and provided updated versions of
firmware since June 2013. However, with infections spreading, they
have issued a notice to users to apply the update.

In JPCERT/CC observations, the infected devices were seen to be placed
in multiple domestic ISP's network. It was determined that users of the
affected products needed to be notified and have released this alert
in conjunction with multiple organizations.

Users of affected products are strongly recommended to apply the solution
as soon as possible.


II. Affected Products
According to Logitec Corp., products and versions affected by the
vulnerability which are exploited for Mirai variant infections are the
following:

  - LAN-WH300N/DR   prior to Ver2.14
  - LAN-W300N/DR    prior to Ver2.14
  - LAN-WH300N/DRCV prior to Ver2.14
  - LAN-WH300N/DRCY prior to Ver2.14
  - LAN-W300N/R     prior to Ver2.33
  - LAN-W300N/RU2   prior to Ver2.33
  - LAN-W300N/RS    prior to Ver2.33
  - LAN-W300N/P     prior to Ver3.09

  - LAN-WH300N/DGR  prior to Ver1.26
  - LAN-WH300N/DGRU prior to Ver1.26

* The above information is as of December 19, 2017. Affected products
  and vendors may change.


III. Solution
For products listed in "II. Affected Products", Logitec Corp. has
provided updated firmware. Users of affected products should check to
make sure that the updated version of firmware is being used. If a
device has already been infected, updating the firmware will delete
the Mirai variant.

Malware such as Mirai and its variants spread infections not just
through the exploitation of vulnerabilities, but also use device ID's
and passwords. In order to prevent a device from becoming infected and
used as part of a botnet, please refer to the following information and
apply any appropriate countermeasures.
