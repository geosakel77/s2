Overview According to Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-16 , there are vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and AIR. These vulnerabilities affect Flash Player, AIR, and possibly other products that support Flash. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. Description Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-16 describesÂ vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash that affect Flash Player and AIR. These vulnerabilities may also affect other products that independently support Flash, such as Adobe Reader, Acrobat, Photoshop, Photoshop Lightroom, Freehand MX, and Fireworks. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open specially crafted Flash content. Flash content is commonly hosted on a web page, but it can also be embedded in a PDF and other documents or provided as a stand-alone file. Impact If a user opens specially crafted Flash content, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. Solution Update Flash and AIR Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-16 recommends updating to Flash Player 10.1.82.76 or 9.0.280 and to AIR 2.0.3. This will update the Flash web browser plug-in and ActiveX control, as well as AIR. However, it will not update Flash support in Adobe Reader, Acrobat, or other products. To reduce your exposure to these and other Flash vulnerabilities, consider the following mitigation technique. Disable Flash in your web browser Uninstall Flash or restrict which sites are allowed to run Flash. To the extent possible, only run trusted Flash content on trusted domains.
