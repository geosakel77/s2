More Alerts Alert (TA04-196A) Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Components and Outlook Express Original release date: July 14, 2004 Systems Affected Microsoft Windows Systems Overview Microsoft has released a Security
Bulletin Summary for July, 2004 . This summary includes several
bulletins that address vulnerabilities in various Windows applications and
components. Exploitation of some vulnerabilities can result in the remote
execution of arbitrary code by a remote attacker. Details of the
vulnerabilities and their impacts are provided below. Description The table below provides a reference between 
Microsoft's Security Bulletins and the related US-CERT Vulnerability 
Notes. More information related to the vulnerabilities is available in 
these documents. Microsoft Security Bulletin Related US-CERT Vulnerability Note(s) MS04-024: Vulnerability in Windows Shell Could 
Allow Remote Code Execution (839645) VU#106324 Microsoft 
Windows contains a
vulnerability in the way the Windows Shell launches applications MS04-023: Vulnerability in HTML Help Could Allow 
Code Execution (840315) VU#187196 Microsoft 
Windows fails to  
properly process showHelp URLs VU#920060 Microsoft 
Windows HTML Help
component fails to properly validate input data MS04-022: Vulnerability in Task Scheduler Could 
Allow Code Execution (841873) VU#228028 Microsoft 
Windows Task
Scheduler Buffer Overflow MS04-021: Security Update for IIS 4.0 
(841373) VU#717748 Microsoft 
Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0 contains a buffer overflow in the redirect
function MS04-020: 
Vulnerability in POSIX Could Allow 
Code Execution (841872) VU#647436 Microsoft
Windows contains a buffer overflow in the POSIX subsystem MS04-019: Vulnerability in Utility Manager Could 
Allow Code Execution (842526) VU#868580 Microsoft 
Windows Utility
Manager launches applications with system privileges MS04-018: Cumulative Security Update for Outlook 
Express (823353) VU#869640 Microsoft
Outlook Express fails to properly validate malformed e-mail 
headers Impact A remote, unauthenticated attacker may exploit VU#717748 to execute
arbitrary code on an IIS 4.0 system. Exploitation of VU#106324 , VU#187196 , VU#920060 , and VU#228028 , would permit a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
current user. The attacker would have to convince a victim to view an HTML
document (web page, HTML email) or click on a crafted URI link. Vulnerabilities described in VU#647436 and VU#868580 permit a local
user to gain elevated privileges on the local system. Exploitation of VU#869640 can lead to a
denial-of-service condition against Outlook Express. Solution Apply a patch Microsoft has provided the patches for these vulnerabilities in the Security 
Bulletins and on Windows Update . Do not follow unsolicited links It is generally a good practice not to click on unsolicited URLs received
in email, instant messages, web forums, or Internet relay chat (IRC)
channels. However, this practice does not always prevent exploitation of
these types vulnerabilities. For example, a trusted web site could be
compromised and modified to deliver exploit script to unsuspecting
clients. Maintain updated anti-virus software Anti-virus software with updated virus definitions may identify and
prevent some exploit attempts, but variations of exploits or attack
vectors may not be detected. Do not rely solely on anti-virus software to
defend against these vulnerabilities.  More information about viruses and
anti-virus vendors is available on the US-CERT Computer
Virus Resources page . Appendix A. Vendor Information Specific information about these issue are available
in the Security
Bulletin Summary for July, 2004 and the US-CERT Vulnerability Notes . Appendix B.
