Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.

Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * iCloud for Windows prior to version 12.3 * Xcode prior to version 12.5 * Safari prior to version 14.1 * macOS Big Sur prior to version 11.3 * macOS Catalina prior to security update 2021-002 * macOS Mojave prior to security update 2021-003 * iOS prior to version 14.5 * iPadOS prior to version 14.5 * watchOS prior to version 7.4 * tvOS prior to version 14.5 * iTunes prior to version 12.11.3 * GarageBand prior to version 10.4.3 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Apple to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a nonprivileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to download, accept or execute files from untrusted and unknown sources. * Remind users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by untrusted or unknown sources. * Evaluate read, write, and execute permissions on all newly installed software. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
