Other versions of Excel, and other Office programs may be affected or act as attack vectors. Overview An unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Excel could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Description Microsoft Excel contains an unspecified vulnerability.  Opening a specially crafted Excel document, including documents hosted on web sites or attached to email messages, could trigger the vulnerability. Office documents can contain embedded objects.  For example, a malicious Excel document could be embedded in an Word or PowerPoint document.  Office documents other than Excel documents could be used as attack vectors. For more information, please see Vulnerability Note VU#802324 . Impact By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Excel document, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.  If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system. Solution At the time of writing, there is no complete solution available.  Consider the following workarounds: Do not open untrusted Excel documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Excel or other Office documents, including those received as email attachments or hosted on a web site.  Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010 for more information. Do not rely on file extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Excel to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension.  For example, if document.x1s (note the digit "1") contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.x1s with Excel. Appendix A.
