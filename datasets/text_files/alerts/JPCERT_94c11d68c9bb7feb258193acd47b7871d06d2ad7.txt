         Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in ISC BIND 9

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2012/at120018.html


I. Overview

  ISC BIND 9 has a vulnerability that can cause a denial of service
(DoS). When BIND handling a zero length record in RDATA field, the
cache DNS server may crash or disclose information in server
memory. Whether BIND acts as a cache DNS server or authoritative DNS
server, it will be affected by this vulnerability.

  
  When BIND acts as an authoritative DNS server, since a special
record must be added to a zone controlled by the administrator, the
exposure from an attack is limited. While, when it acts as a cache DNS
server, a remote attacker may cause a DoS attack by referring to a
specially crafted authoritative DNS server. According to ISC, any
attacks exploiting this vulnerability have not been confirmed yet.
  
  ISC has released a fixed version, so refer to “III. Solution” and
consider applying it.
