Firefox and Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR), the most severe of
which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Mozilla Firefox is a web
browser used to access the Internet. Mozilla Firefox ESR is a version of
the web browser intended to be deployed in large organizations. Impact : Successful exploitation of the most severe of these
vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on
the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full
user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user
rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with
administrative user rights.

System Affected:
* Mozilla Firefox prior to 60
* Mozilla Firefox prior to ESR 52.8 Mitigation :
The following actions are recommended:
* Apply appropriate updates provided by Mozilla to vulnerable systems,
immediately after appropriate testing.
* Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative
privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack.
* Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided
by unknown or un-trusted sources.
* Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext
links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources.
* Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
