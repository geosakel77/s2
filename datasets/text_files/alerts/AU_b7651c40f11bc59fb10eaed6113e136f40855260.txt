The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) observed incidents involving ransomware against 14 of the 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors , including the Defense Industrial Base, Emergency Services, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, and Information Technology Sectors. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) observed continued ransomware targeting of Australian critical infrastructure entities, including in the Healthcare and Medical, Financial Services and Markets, Higher Education and Research, and Energy Sectors. The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) recognizes ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the United Kingdom. Education is one of the top UK sectors targeted by ransomware actors, but the NCSC-UK has also seen attacks targeting businesses, charities, the legal profession, and public services in the Local Government and Health Sectors. Ransomware tactics and techniques continued to evolve in 2021, which demonstrates ransomware threat actors’ growing technological sophistication and an increased ransomware threat to organizations globally. The related advisory authored by cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom—provides observed behaviours and trends as well as mitigation recommendations to help network defenders reduce their risk of compromise by ransomware. 10 Feb 2022 2021 Trends Show Increased Globalized Threat of Ransomware Content written for Individuals & families Small & medium businesses Organisations & critical infrastructure Government View all content First published: 10 Feb 2022 Last updated: 10 Feb 2022 Share on Was this information helpful?
