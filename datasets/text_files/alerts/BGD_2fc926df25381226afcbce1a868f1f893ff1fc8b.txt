The vulnerability is due to a custom executable system file that was built to use relative search paths for libraries without properly validating the library to be loaded. Impact : An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and loading a malicious library that can escalate the privilege level. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full control of the device. The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the device. Mitigation : Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
