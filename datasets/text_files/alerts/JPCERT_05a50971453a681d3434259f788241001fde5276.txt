Alert Regarding Vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-8616, CVE-2020-8617) in ISC BIND 9

       https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2020/at200023.html


I. Overview
ISC BIND 9 contains vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-8616 and CVE-2020-8617).
The vulnerability (CVE-2020-8616) is due to the processing of a
referral response. A remote attacker leveraging this vulnerability may
use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a
high amplification factor, or degrade the performance of the recursing
server.
The vulnerability (CVE-2020-8617) is due to an error in BIND code
which checks the validity of messages containing TSIG resource records.
A remote attacker leveraging this vulnerability may cause named to
terminate or operate in an inconsistent state by sending a
specially-crafted message. According to ISC, since BIND by default
configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration
does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are
vulnerable.

ISC has rated the severity of these vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-8616 and
CVE-2020-8617) as "High." For more information on the vulnerabilities,
please refer to the information provided by ISC.

Also, the vulnerability CVE-2020-8616 is reported upon the finding of
attack method called NXNSAttack. Several other DNS software including
BIND is affected.

If you are operating an affected version of ISC BIND 9, please consider
updating to a version that addresses these vulnerabilities by referring
to the information in "III. Solution".
