     MPack: Web Site Exploit Tool Targets Web Browsers and Applications

             http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2007/at070016.txt

I. Overview

  Damages caused by attacks using an attack tool called MPack have
been increasing, mostly overseas.

  When compared to the existing attack tools, MPack has a number of
management program functions, allowing injection of attack code to
exploit the latest vulnerabilities. As MPack is sold by foreign 
websites and easily available, there is concern that attacks using
MPack will also rapidly increase in Japan.

  Server administrators should confirm that their websites are not
used as launching points by attackers and end users should take
measures against known vulnerabilities.


II. Details

  1. MPack program configuration

    The MPack program mainly consists of the following two programs:

        A: MPack management program that runs on a web server
        B: Attack code executed on a victim's computer

    An attacker deploys the attack code (B) on a web server and leads
    the victim to the web server in some way.


  2. Scenario of attack

    The following is a representative scenario of an attack using
    MPack:

    Step 1: An attacker breaks into a web server using various
            techniques.

    Step 2: The attacker includes an iframe to load the MPack attack
            code into an HTML document.

    Step 3: When a victim views the HTML document containing the
            iframe written in Step 2, the MPack attack code will 
            execute automatically.

    Step 4: When the victim accesses the MPack attack code, it 
            distinguishes the OS and browser type and exploits 
            vulnerabilities in the victim's computer.

    Step 5: If the victim's computer contains a vulnerability that
            can be exploited by MPack, a malicious program created by
            an attacker could be executed.

    Other than the above scenario, attacks using spam leading to
    hostile websites or exploiting a cross-site scripting 
    vulnerability on a website can be expected.


  3. Vulnerabilities exploited by MPack

    As a result of the analysis by JPCERT/CC, MPack can exploit the
    following vulnerabilities:

    - MS06-014, CVE-2006-0003
      Vulnerability in the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)

    - MS06-006, CVE-2006-0005
      Vulnerability in Windows Media Player

    - MS06-044, CVE-2006-3643
      Vulnerability in Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

    - MS06-071, CVE-2006-5745
      Vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services

    - MS06-057, CVE-2006-3730
      Windows Shell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

    - CVE-2006-5198, VU#512804
      WinZip FileView ActiveX Control Multiple Vulnerabilities

    - CVE-2007-0015, JVNTA07-005A, VU#442497
      Apple QuickTime Vulnerabilities

    - MS07-017, CVE-2007-0038
      Windows Animated Cursor Vulnerability


    Addition of modules to MPack could cause other vulnerabilities to
    be exploited in the future.


III Solution

   JPCERT/CC recommends the following measures to be taken agains
MPack:

  [Server administrators]

    Please ensure that the integrity of content published on your
website is not compromised. If you find such a compromise, please
conduct an investigation as to the possibility that an attacker has
broken into the server, etc.

    An attack using MPack can insert an iframe with the following 
characteristics into HTML documents on a managed web server. Such
cases have already been reported in Japan.

    Characteristic 1: An iframe referencing an unknown domain or IP
                      address
    Characteristic 2: An iframe that is not displayed in a browser, 
                      using style='visibility: hidden;'


  [End users]

    MPack attempts to exploit vulnerabilities that have already been
    patched. Therefore the possibility of being a victim can be
    reduced by applying the following measures:

    - Keep your OS and applications up-to-date.
    - Use anti-virus software
