spreading on the Internet through email attachments, peer-to-peer file
sharing networks and known software vulnerabilities. Intruders target home users who have cable modem and DSL
connections because many home users do not keep their machines up to
date with security patches and workarounds, do not run current
anti-virus software, and do not exercise caution when handling email
attachments. Everyone should take precautions, patch vulnerabilities,
and recover if you have been compromised. Current Threats US-CERT is currently tracking the incident activity related to
several pieces of malicious code - Phatbot, W32/Beagle, W32/Netsky and
W32/MyDoom. Phatbot Trojan Horse The Phatbot Trojan Horse is a piece of malicious code that allows a
remote attacker to control a large number of systems. Phatbot attempts
to propagate by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows
operating system for which users have not applied the available
patches. If your computer is infected a remote attacker will have
access to your files and programs. W32/Beagle Virus The W32/Beagle virus is a mass-mailing virus that arrives as an
attachment to an email message. To be infected, a user must open the
attachment. There are many variants of this virus. Some may require a
password which is included in the email message. W32/Netsky Virus The Netsky.B virus, described in IN-2004-02 ,
is a mass-mailing virus that attempts to propagate either as an
attachment to an email message or by copying itself to Windows network
shares. W32/MyDoom Virus The MyDoom virus, described in TA04-028A ,
is a mass-mailing virus that attempts to propagate as an attachment to
an email message. Protective Measures There are steps you can take to better protect your system from
these attacks: Apply Patches Many viruses spread by exploiting known vulnerabilities in
unpatched systems. It is very important for users to apply
security-related patches to their operating systems and
applications. Install and Maintain Anti-Virus Software US-CERT strongly recommends using anti-virus software. Most current
anti-virus software products detect and alert the user of viruses. It
is important to keep them up to date with current virus and attack
signatures supplied by the software vendor. Many anti-virus packages
support automatic updates of virus definitions. We recommend using
these automatic updates when available. Deploy a Firewall US-CERT also recommends using a firewall product. In some
situations, these products may be able to alert users to the fact that
their machine has been compromised. Furthermore, they have the ability
to block intruders from accessing backdoors over the network. However,
no firewall can detect or stop all attacks, so it is important to
continue to follow safe computing practices. Follow Best Practices The technical measures listed above do not provide a complete
solution for securing a system. There are some best practices you can
follow: Do not download, install, or run a program unless you know it
was written by a person or company that you trust. Email users should be wary of unexpected attachments. Be sure you
know the source of an attachment before opening it. Also remember that
it is not enough that the mail originated from an email address you
recognize. Many viruses spread precisely because they originate from a
familiar email address. Users should also be wary of URLs in email or instant
messages. URLs can link to malicious content that in some cases may be
executed without user intervention. A common social engineering
technique known as "phishing" uses misleading URLs to entice users to
visit malicious web sites. These sites spoof legitimate web sites to
solicit sensitive information such as passwords or account
numbers. In addition, users of Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Instant Messaging
(IM), and file-sharing services should be particularly careful of
following links or running software sent to them by other users. These
are commonly used methods among intruders attempting to build networks
of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) agents. For additional information about securing home systems and
networks, please see the references below. Recovery If the protective measures above, or other indicators, reveal that
a system has already been compromised, more drastic steps need to be
taken to recover. In general, the only way to ensure that a
compromised computer is free from backdoors and intruder modifications
is to re-install t Description W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> Continuing Threats to Home Users View Previous Alerts Alert (SA04-079A) Continuing Threats to Home Users Original Release date: March 19, 2004 | Last revised: -- Print Document Tweet Like Me Share Overview There are a number of pieces of malicious code

package to "clean" the system may not be enough. References Before
