Overview According to Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-22 there are vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash. These vulnerabilities affect Flash Player, Reader, and possibly other products that support Flash. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. Description Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-22 describes vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash that affect Flash Player. These vulnerabilities may also affect other products that independently support Flash, such as Adobe Reader, Acrobat, Photoshop, Photoshop Lightroom, Freehand MX, and Fireworks. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open specially crafted Flash content. Flash content is commonly hosted on a web page, but it can also be embedded in a PDF and other documents or provided as a stand-alone file. Impact If a user opens specially crafted Flash content, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. Solution Update Flash Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-22 recommends updating to Flash Player 10.1.85.3 for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Solaris and Flash Player 10.1.95.1 for Android.  However, products like Adobe Reader with embedded Flash will require their own security updates. To reduce your exposure to these and other Flash vulnerabilities, consider the following mitigation technique. Disable Flash in your web browser Uninstall Flash or restrict which sites are allowed to run Flash. To the extent possible, only run trusted Flash content on trusted domains.
