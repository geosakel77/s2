    Microsoft Update
    http://www.update.microsoft.com/

    Windows Update
    http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/

  * With the April 2014 update, Microsoft ended the support for
    Windows XP and Office 2003. Concerns on security risk will rise
    henceforth, and therefore please consider updating to a newer OS
    and software.

If you applied the workaround, then you may need to undo the workaround
before or after applying the security update.

 - If you applied the workaround to modify the Access Control List(ACL)
on VGX.DLL, then you must undo this workaround before applying the
security update. 

 - If you applied the workaround to unregister VGX.DLL, you do not have
to undo this workaround before applying the security update. However,
the security update will not re-register vgx.dll, therefore please
re-register vgx.dll.

 - If you applied any of the other workarounds, you do not have to undo
the workaround before applying the security update.
