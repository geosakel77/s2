BIG-IP is a family of products covering software and hardware designed around application availability, access control, and security solutions. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service to all servers sitting behind the BIG-IP system. IMPACT: A vulnerability has been discovered in F5Networks BIG-IP, which could result in a denial-of-service (DoS). This vulnerability exists when a FastL4 profile and an HTTP, FIX, and/or hash persistence profile are configured on the same virtual server, and undisclosed requests are received which can cause the virtual server to stop processing new client connections (CVE-2022-23027). Although this is a non-default configuration, FastL4 is a layer 4 profile to increase performance so having a FastL4 profile and a HTTP profile is likely not uncommon in deployments. The virtual server is utilized as a way to route connection over a certain port to specific servers so if the virtual server for port 80 or 443 was affected successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the impacted system to not allow any new client connections to webservers. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service to all servers sitting behind the BIG-IP system.
