Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights. IMPACT: There are reports that the Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527), Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-33771, CVE-2021-31979) and Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2021-34448) are actively being exploited in the wild.
