Remote code execution (RCE) attacks allow an attacker to remotely execute malicious code on a computer. The impact of an RCE vulnerability can range from malware execution to an attacker gaining full control over a compromised machine. RCE vulnerabilities are some of the most risky and high-impact vulnerabilities today. Many major cyberattacks have been enabled by RCE vulnerabilities for example: Log4j , ProxyShell . See below for the top used CVEs by malicious cyber actor. Apache CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 3.0: 10 (Critical) Vulnerability Description Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against malicious actor controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. A malicious actor who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects. Recommended Mitigations Apply patches provided by vendor and perform required system updates. Reference https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html Guidance for preventing, detecting, and hunting for exploitation of the Log4j 2 vulnerability Apache CVE-2022-24112 CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) Vulnerability Description A malicious actor can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX’s data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed. Recommended Mitigations In affected versions of Apache APISIX, you can avoid this risk by explicitly commenting out batch-requests in the conf/config.yaml and conf/config-default.yaml files and restarting Apache APISIX. Update to 2.10.4 or 2.12.1. Reference https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2022/02/11/cve-2022-24112/ https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/11/3 https://lists.apache.org/thread/lcdqywz8zy94mdysk7p3gfdgn51jmt94 Apache CVE-2021-41773 CVSS 3.0: 7.5 (High) Vulnerability Description A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A malicious actor could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration “require all denied,” these requests can succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see CVE-2021-42013). Recommended Mitigations Apply update or patch.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an authenticated malicious actor could send malicious requests to an affected server. A malicious actor  who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities would execute arbitrary code and compromise the affected systems. If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an adversary to obtain access to sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, cause a denial of service conditions, and/or perform unauthorized actions on the affected Exchange server, which could aid in further malicious activity. Recommended Mitigations Apply the appropriate Microsoft Security Update.

An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges on the system. Recommended Mitigations The vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25, and 5.10.102. See Vendor Advisory for recommended mitigations.

This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to, for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. Recommended Mitigations See Vendor Advisory for recommended mitigations.

The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn’t handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it’ll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.
