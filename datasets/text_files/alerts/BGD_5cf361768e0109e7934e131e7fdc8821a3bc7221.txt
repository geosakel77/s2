This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Note that the password reset email will be delivered to victim’s email address only, but since the From and Return-Path fields now point to attacker’s email ID, the attacker can also receive reset code under following scenarios: If, in case, the victim replies to that email, it will be delivered to attacker email ID (mentioned in ‘From’ field), containing a password reset link in the message history. If, for some reason, victim’s email server is down, the password reset email will automatically bounce-back to the email address mentioned in “Return-Path” field, which points to the attacker’s inbox. In another possible scenario, to forcefully retrieve bounce-back email, the attacker can perform a DDoS attack against the victim’s email server or send a large number of emails, so that the victim’s email account can no longer receive any email. Impact : Attackers can exploit this issue to bypass certain security restrictions to perform unauthorized actions. This may aid in further attacks. WordPress 4.7.4 and prior are vulnerable. Mitigation : No official solution is still available. As a temporary solution users can enable UseCanonicalName to enforce static SERVER_NAME value ( https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname ) Reference URL’s: https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wordpress-zero-day-could-expose-password-reset-emails/ https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8295 http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98295/info Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
