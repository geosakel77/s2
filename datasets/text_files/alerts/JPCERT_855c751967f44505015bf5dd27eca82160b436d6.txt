Users of 64-bit Windows may have 32-bit and/or 64-bit versions of
JDK/JRE installed. Please check the versions installed on your system
and apply the appropriate updates.

Users can check the version of Java that they are using at the page

be a request to install Java. If you do not require Java, please do
