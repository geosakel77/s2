The prime elements of this vulnerability are the weak encryption standards and the authentication process used in the Netlogon protocol. As new Windows Domain Controllers use standard AES-256 as encryption standards, incorrect use of the AES mode results in spoofing the identity of any computer (DC) account and replace it with all zeroes or empty passwords. As the final output replaces all characters of the password with zeroes, this bug is also well-known as “Zerologon”. Severity: 10.0 CRITICAL Impact: After successfully exploiting this vulnerability, attackers are able to elevate their privileges to a domain administrator and take over a domain.
