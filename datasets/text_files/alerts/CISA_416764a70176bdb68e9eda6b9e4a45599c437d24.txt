follow a link, an attacker may be able to send you to a malicious
site. Don't click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant
messages, web forums, or Internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Read and send email in plain text format - Many email
clients use the same programs as web browsers to display HTML, so
vulnerabilities that affect active content like JavaScript and ActiveX
often apply to email. Maintain updated anti-virus software - It is important
that you use anti-virus software and keep it up to date. Most
anti-virus software vendors frequently release updated information,
tools, or virus databases to help detect and recover from virus
infections. Many anti-virus packages support automatic updates of
virus definitions. US-CERT recommends using these automatic updates
when possible. Description There is a vulnerability in the way Internet Explorer processes
certain HTML code. By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker may be
able to take control of your computer or cause a denial of service. For more technical information, see TA04-315A .
