     Alert Regarding Vulnerabilities in Multiple SSL VPN Products

       https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2019/at190033.html


I. Overview
JPCERT/CC confirmed details of vulnerabilities in multiple SSL VPN
products including Proof-of-Concept code have been made public.

  - Palo Alto Networks (CVE-2019-1579)
  - Fortinet (CVE-2018-13379)
  - Pulse Secure (CVE-2019-11510)

If these vulnerabilities are exploited, a remote attacker may execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2019-1579) or disclose sensitive information by
reading arbitrary file (CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2019-11510).
Also, reporter of the vulnerabilities revealed information about
vulnerabilities other than listed above for each product. Since the
vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited as the details of the
vulnerabilities such as the Proof-of-Concept code have already been
made public, it is recommended to update the affected system to the
latest version as soon as possible.

On August 24, 2019 (local time), Bad Packets already published a blog
and revealed that scanning activities targeting the vulnerability in
Pulse Connect Secure (CVE-2019-11510) were observed.

    Bad Packets
    Over 14,500 Pulse Secure VPN endpoints vulnerable to CVE-2019-11510
    https://badpackets.net/over-14500-pulse-secure-vpn-endpoints-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-11510/

JPCERT/CC's sensors also observed the scans which seem to be similar.
Figure 1 shows scans observed at JPCERT/CC's sensors from IP address
observed by Bad Packets.

On August 31, 2019 (local time), according to Bad Packets, 10,471 hosts
were confirmed to be vulnerable, and 1,381 of them were hosts in Japan.
Upon receiving this report, JPCERT/CC started contacting administrators
of these hosts.

** Update: September 6, 2019 Update **********************************
JPCERT/CC received information from other organization that an attack
seemingly exploiting the vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510) has been
observed on September 2, 2019 (Japan Time). As the attack is observed,
it is strongly recommended to implement the solution stated below.

Also, aside from the vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510), JPCERT/CC is aware
that the information of the command injection vulnerability
(CVE-2019-11539) which includes Proof-of-Concept code has been made
public. If these vulnerabilities are exploited, a remote attacker may
execute arbitrary command on device running the affected product.
