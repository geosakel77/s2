SolarWinds Serv-U is an FTP server software for secure file transfer. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of this vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: A vulnerability has been discovered in SolarWinds Serv-U, which could result in remote code execution. SolarWinds Serv-U is prone to a remote memory escape vulnerability that could allow a threat actor to run arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of this vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * SolarWinds Serv-U versions prior to Serv-U 15.2.3 HF2 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates provided by SolarWinds to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
