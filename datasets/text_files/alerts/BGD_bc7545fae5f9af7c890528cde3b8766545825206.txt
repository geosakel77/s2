Investigate for exploitation or indicators of persistence. Remediate any identified exploitation or persistence and investigate your environment for indicators of lateral movement or further compromise. Investigate for exploitation, persistence, or evidence of lateral movement Analyze the Exchange product logs for evidence of exploitation.
