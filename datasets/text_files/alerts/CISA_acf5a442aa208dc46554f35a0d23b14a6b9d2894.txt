Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-055 . This update is available on the Microsoft Update site. System administrators may wish to consider using Windows Server Update Services ( WSUS ). Disable VML support Microsoft Security Advisory ( 925568 ) suggests the following techniques to disable VML support: Un-register Vgx.dll on Windows XP Service Pack 1; Windows XP Service Pack 2; Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 Modify the Access Control List on Vgx.dll to be more restrictive Configure Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 to disable Binary and Script Behaviors in the Internet and Local Intranet security zone Disabling VML support may cause web sites and applications that use VML to function improperly. Render email as plain text Microsoft Security Advisory ( 925568 ) suggests configuring Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to render email messages in plain text format. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting.
