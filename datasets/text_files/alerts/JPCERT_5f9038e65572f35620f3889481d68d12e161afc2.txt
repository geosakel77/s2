I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has confirmed attacks targeting a known vulnerability in 
Oracle's Java SE JDK and JRE. A remote attackers may execute arbitrary

  JPCERT/CC has confirmed attack sites exploiting this vulnerability, 
and has confirmed at present two methods of attack.

  1. Standard websites are altered, redirecting users who access the 
     site to an attack site, where malware infection is intended.
  2. Users clicking on a link in the text of a spam e-mail are sent to
     an attack site, where malware infection is intended.

  This exploit has already been found in some vulnerability diagnosis 
tools, and some of the exploit kits used by the so-called gumblar 
botnet. Attack activity targeting this vulnerability may increase in 
the future, so it is recommended to apply the software update provided
by Oracle that addresses this vulnerability.
