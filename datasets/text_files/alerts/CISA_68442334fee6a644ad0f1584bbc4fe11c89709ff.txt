According to Oracle, none of the vulnerabilities corrected in the Oracle Critical Patch Update affect Oracle Database Client-only installations. In most cases, Oracle does not associate Vuln# identifiers (e.g., DB01) with other available information. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the Vulnerability Notes Database . Impact The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to gain access to sensitive information.
