Alert on unauthorized use of domain administrative account for Active Directory

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2014/at140054.html


I. Overview

  At JPCERT/CC, we have observed multiple targeted attacks against
domestic organizations where attackers intruded and stay within a
corporate network for long periods of time and steal information. One
characteristic of these attacks is that the attackers in the network
steal credentials for the domain administrator account (herein,
administrator account) in Active Directory, and leverage this
administrator account to launch various attacks across the network.

  Administrator accounts used within an organization can access many
systems within the organization. This results in intrusions into
computers or servers, spreading malware infections and information
theft.

  In most of the currently observed cases, unauthorized access to such
administrator accounts via network intrusion were identified by
checking the logs periodically.

  In order to verify that an administrator account is not being
leveraged for an attack, we recommend checking logs as described in
the following section "II. Attack Detection". Also to reduce the
effects of an attack, consider the solutions as below.


II. Attack Detection

  Organizations that use Active Directory may have many inactive
accounts due to transferred/resigned employees or system suspension.
Some accounts may not obey the least privilege rule, which may grant
them wider or unnecessary administrative privileges.  JPCERT/CC has
observed many instances where operationally unnecessary administrator
accounts are being leveraged in attacks within an organization.

  In order to detect unauthorized use of administrator accounts,
refer to the "Checking Administrator Accounts" list below and check
the authentication logs of Active Directory, event logs of user
computers, network logs such as firewall.

[Checking Administrator Accounts]
- Login Status
  - Is there any accounts in operation that are not supposed to be?
- Destination ip address/host
  - Any logons or logon attempts to user computers, servers or domain
    controllers by an administrator?
- Source ip address/host
  - Any account usage from any unusual computers?
- Time period
  - Are there access attempts during days off or late night / early
    morning outside of normal business hours?
- Operations performed
  - Are there unexpected operations, such as addition of an
    administrator account, changing of policies or deletion of event
    logs?

III. Solution

 In order to reduce the effects from unauthorized use of
administrator accounts, consider the following solutions.

- Keep the OS and software on administrator computers and critical
  servers up to date with the latest versions
- Apply the least privilege rule to all accounts
- Set a strong password for the administrator account
- Periodically monitor the administrator account, review privileges
  and delete any unnecessary administrator accounts
- When performing operations as an administrator, logon using a non-
  administrator account first, and then perform the operations using
  an administrator account temporarily
- Restrict access to critical servers from non-administrative
  computers
- Use the administrator account only on trusted computers from a
  separate network segment
- Manage and restrict administrator logons by using multi-factor
  authentication with smartcards for instance
- Manage a whitelist for computers that logon as administrator or
  computers that are logged onto
- Accounts with the user name "Administrator" are easily determined to
  be administrator accounts and result in being frequently targeted,
  so change the name, delete or disable the account as necessary
- Periodically monitor the usage of the administrator accounts
