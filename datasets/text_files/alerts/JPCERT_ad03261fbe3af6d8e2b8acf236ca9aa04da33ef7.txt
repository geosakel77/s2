          Alert on managing devices connected to the Internet
     - Various devices connected to the Internet are under threat -

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2016/at160050.html


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has been observing surveillance cameras, storage devices,
embedded communications devices for industry, DVR's (Digital Video
Recorders) and other devices infected with malware such as "Mirai"
which targets these types of devices, and packets that continue to
search for these devices. In particular, security experts have pointed
out that these malware-infected devices are combining to form "IoT
Botnets," which are being exploited by attackers to perform large
scale DDoS attacks. US-CERT in the United States has also published
information on this issue as a warning.

  Devices with vulnerabilities or lack of proper configuration have
been exploited by malware, and attacks which leverages these devices
are observed significantly in Japan. It is fairly simple to find devices
connected to the Internet that do not have countermeasures in place,
and JPCERT/CC has observed multiple vulnerabilities being exploited
for use by various types of malware for these infections. For details
on the attacks that JPCERT/CC has been observing, please refer to
"II. Attack Observations".

  Based on the current status of the attacks being observed, it can be
assumed that not only will attacks increase but the vulnerabilities
used for exploitation will change. For those that use Internet-reachable
devices not just at the offices but also at home, it is necessary to
double check its configuration to make sure that the device will not
be exploited for use in conducting other attacks or secondary effects
such as information being stolen. For Internet-reachable devices, it
is recommended to review configuration, or update any firmware.
Consider the following points when applying any countermeasures. For
more details, please refer to "IV. Solution"

  (1) Check whether the device is accessible from the Internet
  (2) Configure a strong password, enable authentication functions
  (3) Perform a firmware update

  In preparation for attacks that may occur during the extended
vacation period, consider shutting off any devices that will not be
used for work during the vacation period.


II. Attack Observations

  When a device is infected with malware, it performs scans and
attacks against other devices that are accessible from the Internet.
For characteristics and the behavior of the malware, please refer to
"III. Malware Behavior".
  Based on TSUBAME, a network packet monitoring system run by
JPCERT/CC, a large number of packets to Port23/TCP (telnet) which is
considered to be scanning activities, have been observed. In addition,
scan packets targeting services that run on other ports have been
observed as well.

  - Figure 1 below shows the change in packets observed in TSUBAME by
    JPCERT/CC to Port23/TCP and Port2323/TCP, suspected to be scanning
    for these devices

[Figure 1: Change in the number of scan packets to Port23/TCP,
           Port2323/TCP from April through December, 2016]

  - Main ports where scan packets have been observed
    23/TCP, 2323/TCP, 6789/TCP, 7547/TCP, 37777/TCP, 27312/TCP,
    5555/TCP, 53413/UDP
    Changes in the number of packets to these ports are shown in
    Figure 2
    * In JPCERT/CC observations, ports other than telnet have been
      targeted
    * Port7547/TCP has seen a sudden increase in access, so it has
      been removed from Figure 2

[Figure 2: Change in the number of scan packets observed from
           November through December, 2016]

  Analysis of the communications to these ports revealed attack
activities such as the creation of backdoors, forwarding another
types of malware for execution, etc.


III. Malware Behavior

  JPCERT/CC has analyzed multiple samples and has confirmed that most
of the malware contains the following functions:

  - Communications with a C&amp;C (Command and Control) server
  - Performs telnet scans for searching and spreading infections
  - Performs HTTP based DoS attacks
  - Performs UDP based DoS attacks
  - Performs TCP based DoS attacks
  etc.

  Note that the malware has capability to run on embedded devices
such as routers and cameras.


IV. Solution

  If a device is connected to the Internet and configured to use
remotely, it is recommended to perform the following countermeasures.
Also, for any new devices to be installed, perform the following
steps prior to use.
  The method to change the configuration varies depending on the
device. It is recommended to refer to the device manual or consult
with the company that placed the device when performing these
countermeasures. In addition, check the device logs and make sure that
there is no evidence that unauthorized third-parties are using the
device.

  (1) Check whether the device is accessible from the Internet
      Check whether a device being used at the office or at home can
      be accessed from the Internet unintentionally.
      For connections to the Internet, a device may be unintentionally
      configured with a global IP address.
      Check that access to the device is restricted by a router or
      firewall.  
      Caution is necessary since functions such as UPnP (Universal
      Plug and Play) may be used to access these devices under a NAT
      environment.
      If access from the Internet is necessary for business or other
      purposes, restrict access so that it only allows from specific
      IP addresses or through a VPN.

  (2) Configure a strong password, enable authentication function
      Devices that can be connected to Internet may have the
      authentication function disabled by default when shipped out of
      the factory or use a common ID and password combination by
      default. The ID and password that is configured by default may
      be found on the Internet for some products, and attackers may
      use this for unauthorized access into a device. Thus, please
      enable authentication and configure a strong password. Also,
      check all of the ID's, and if there are any that are unfamiliar
      to any of the users, stop using them or delete them.

      - Example of default configured or simple ID / Password
      * This is only one example, thus other combinations may exist.
        Other ID's may include "administrator" or "guest". Other 
        passwords may include short combination of numbers (ex. "1234"), 
        or a string of the same number (ex. "00000000").
        
            |  ID  |       Password        |
            | root | Pass                  |
            | root | admin                 |
            | root | * Product type number |

  (3) Perform a firmware update
      Based on the current observations, JPCERT/CC is assuming that
      attackers may persistently attack known security issues. Please
      update firmware that have addressed known security issues
      including vulnerabilities. In order to prevent unexpected
      damages, it is recommended to periodically check for updates.

  (4) How to handle if there is suspicion of a malware infection
      There are cases where the malware exists on the device's memory,
      so disconnecting the device from the network, rebooting,
      configuring a strong password, and then re-connecting to the
      network will allow you to remove the infection and use the
      device again. 
      If re-connected to the network without changing the password or
      updating, the firmware may cause the device to become infected
      again.

  In order to prevent unexpected damages, it is important to consider
security when using devices. Administrators should know all of the
devices that are placed in the organization and do their best to
ensure that they are properly configured. Also, in order to increase
security awareness within the organization, please consider alerting
users or changing organization rules as necessary.
