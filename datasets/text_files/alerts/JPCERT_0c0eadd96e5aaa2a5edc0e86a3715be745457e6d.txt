 Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in ISC BIND 9 (CVE-2012-4244)

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2012/at120029.html


I. Overview

  ISC BIND 9 has a vulnerability that may cause a denial of service
(DoS).  If a record with RDATA in excess of 65,535 bytes is loaded
into BIND, a subsequent query for that record will cause named to exit
with an assertion failure.
  According to the advisory of Internet Systems Consortium (ISC),
attacks exploiting this vulnerability have not been confirmed;
however, users are advised to update to the latest version by
referring to the solution shown in III, since all DNS servers using
ISC BIND 9 (i.e. authoritative DNS server, cache DNS server) are
affected, and the method of attack is relatively simple.
