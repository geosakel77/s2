  - Disable AJP if AJP is not required
  - Restrict access such as AJP authentication settings if AJP is required

[Setting Example]
  Settings on the Tomcat
  - Perform the following settings for Connector port in
<catalina_base>
 /conf/server.xml

=====================================================================
 <connector address="YOUR_TOMCAT_IP_ADDRESS" port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectport="8443" requiredsecret="YOUR_TOMCAT_AJP_SECRET">
 </connector>
 =====================================================================

  Setting on the Apache
  - Make the following settings for ProxyPass in /conf/httpd.conf

=====================================================================

 ProxyPass "URL" secret = "YOUR_TOMCAT_AJP_SECRET"

=====================================================================

Use a value that cannot be easily guessed for YOUR_TOMCAT_AJP_SECRET.
As for the details of setting, please refer to the manual of Tomcat,
mod_proxy and mod_proxy_ajp.

** Update: February 28, 2020 Update **********************************
JPCERT/CC has confirmed that [Setting Example] does not work with the
latest version of Apache (2.4.41) at this time. We apologize for the
inconvenience. According to information from the developers, the
function will be implemented in Apache 2.4.42.

Depending on the Apache distributed by each distributor, a security
patch has already been applied and [Setting Example] can be applied
in some distributions (JPCERT/CC has confirmed on CentOS7). For more
details, please contact with each distributor.

In addition, JPCERT/CC has confirmed that the workaround works by
setting authentication information in Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk).
For more detail of settings, please refer to the information provided
by Apache Software Foundation.
