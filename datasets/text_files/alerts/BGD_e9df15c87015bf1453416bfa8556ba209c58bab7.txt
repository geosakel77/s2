An attacker can upload arbitrary files through amavisd via a cpio loophole (extraction to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public) that can lead to incorrect access to any other user accounts. Zimbra recommends pax over cpio. Also, pax is in the prerequisites of Zimbra on Ubuntu; however, pax is no longer part of a default Red Hat installation after RHEL 6 (or CentOS 6). Once pax is installed, amavisd automatically prefers it over cpio. Recommended Mitigations Zimbra released a patch for CVE-2022-41352 on October 10, 2022. The patched version is Zimbra Collaboration Suite 9.0.0 P27 https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P27 Zimbra has provided a workaround, which is to install the pax utility and restart the Zimbra services.
