          Fraudulent Phone Calls Attempt to Steal ID and Password

             http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2007/at070015.txt

I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has received reports about fraudulent phone calls
attempting to steal IDs and passwords using a false identity as an
ISP's outsourcer.

  According to the reports, persons identifying themselves as an
ISP's outsourcer attempt to steal IDs and passwords from service
users while pretending to provide information on changes to PC
settings (OP25B* settings). The callers attempt to identify the name
of the user's ISP during the conversation.

  Care should be taken not to give your ID and password to persons
making such phone calls.

  * OP25B (Outbound Port 25 Blocking):
    OP25B is one of the measures against virus and unsolicited emails
      implemented by ISPs.


II. Solution

[Service users]

  This activity uses a social engineering technique called
"spoofing." In the event that you receive a phone call from someone
identifying themselves as a provider of ISP-related services asking
for your ID and password, never answer their questions.

  If you have given your ID and password over the phone to someone
who called you, change your password and contact your ISP immediately.


[ISP]

  ISPs should be prepared to respond to inquiries from customers and
raise the awareness of their customers.
