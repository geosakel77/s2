I. Overview
On January 15, 2019 (local time), Oracle released critical patch updates
for multiple Oracle products.

    Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2019
    https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html

A remote attacker may cause the application to crash or execute
arbitrary code by leveraging these vulnerabilities. Users of the
affected products are recommended to update to the latest version
appropriately.


II. Affected Products
Products affected by these vulnerabilities include:

  - Java SE JDK/JRE 8 Update 192 and earlier

However, since there are many other versions and products affected by
these vulnerabilities, please refer to the information provided by
Oracle for more details.

In addition, there are cases where Java JRE is pre-installed on the PC
or Weblogic is used in software products for servers. Please check if
any of the affected products is included in the PCs or servers that
you use.

According to Oracle, Java SE, Java SE JDK/JRE 7, which had already ended
Public Updates, are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Extended Support for Java SE JDK/JRE 6 has ended in December 2018.
Therefore there is no description for Java SE JDK/JRE 6 in this
critical patch update.


III. Solution
Oracle has released updates for each product.
For Java SE, Oracle Database and Weblogic, the following versions
have been released:

  - Java SE JDK/JRE 8 Update 201

In addition, for this Java SE JDK/JRE 8 Update, a critical patch
update(8u202), including all of 8u201 plus additional features, is
available for developers and users. Please consider updating to 8u202
as necessary, since it also includes fixes for issues other than
these vulnerabilities.

after updating the software to the latest version. Please update to
the latest version after considering any possible impacts to
applications that you may use.
