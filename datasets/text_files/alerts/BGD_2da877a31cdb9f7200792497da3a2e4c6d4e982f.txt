A series of vulnerabilities in the popular Java-based logging library Log4j is under active exploitation by multiple threat actors. The current list of vulnerabilities and recommended fixes are listed here: CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0- CRITICAL) – Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI-related endpoints. A remote code execution vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1. Fixed in Log4j 2.15.0 (Java 8). Reference: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html CVE-2021-45046 (CVSS score: 9.0 – CRITICAL) – Apache Log4j2 Thread Context Lookup Pattern vulnerable to remote code execution in certain non-default configurations. Affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding 2.12.2. Fixed in Log4j 2.12.2 (Java 7) and Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8). Reference:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5 – HIGH) – Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process. This is also known as a DOS (Denial of Service) attack. Affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0. Fixed in Log4j 2.17.0 (Java 8). Reference: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html Recommended action: It is suggested to follow the advice of Apache and install the latest updates immediately. Organizations should update both internet-facing and non-internet facing software. Enumerate unknown instances of Log4j within the Organization. Deploy protective network monitoring/blocking. Organizations using Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) should ensure rules are available to protect against this vulnerability.
