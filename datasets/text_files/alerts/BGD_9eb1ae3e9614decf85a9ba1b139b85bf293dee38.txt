Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an an attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data.

(CVE-2021-30892) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an an attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * iOS and iPadOS prior to 15.1 * iOS and iPadOS prior to 14.8.1 * macOS Monterey prior to 12.0.1 * macOS Big Sur prior to 11.6.1 * macOS Catalina prior to security update 2021-007 * watchOS prior to 8.1 * tvOS prior to 15.1 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Apple to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a nonprivileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to download, accept or execute files from untrusted and unknown sources. * Remind users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by untrusted or unknown sources. * Evaluate read, write, and execute permissions on all newly installed software. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
