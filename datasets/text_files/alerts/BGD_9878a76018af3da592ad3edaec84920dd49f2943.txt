To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a link that has a specially crafted URL, and convince the user to click the link. When an authenticated Exchange user clicks the link, the authenticated user’s browser session could be redirected to a malicious site that is designed to impersonate a legitimate website. By doing so, the attacker could trick the user and potentially acquire sensitive information, such as the user’s credentials. Impact :  An attacker can leverage this issue by constructing a crafted URI and enticing a user to follow it. When an unsuspecting victim follows the link, they may be redirected to an attacker-controlled site; this may aid in phishing attacks. Other attacks are possible. Mitigation : Updates are available. Please check specific vendor advisory for more information.
