More Alerts Alert (TA04-260A) Microsoft Windows JPEG component buffer overflow Original release date: September 16, 2004 Systems Affected This vulnerability affects the following 
Microsoft Windows operating systems by default: Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Microsoft Windows Server 2003 64-Bit Edition Other Microsoft Windows operating systems, including systems running
Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, are not affected by default. However,
this vulnerability may affect all versions of the Microsoft Windows
operating systems if an application or update installs a vulnerable
version of the gdiplus.dll file onto the system. Please note that this vulnerability affects any software that uses the
Microsoft Windows operating system or Microsoft's GDI+ library to render
JPEG graphics. Please see the Systems Affected
section of the vulnerability note to determine if third-party software
is affected. A list of affected Microsoft products is available in Appendix B , or for the complete list of affected and
non-affected Microsoft products, please see Microsoft Security 
Bulletin MS04-028 . Overview Microsoft's Graphic Device Interface Plus (GDI+) contains a
vulnerability in the processing of JPEG images.  This vulnerability may
allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected
system.  Exploitation may occur as the result of viewing a malicious web
site, reading an HTML-rendered email message, or opening a crafted JPEG
image in any vulnerable application. The privileges gained by a remote
attacker depend on the software component being attacked. Description Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028 describes a remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in
Microsoft's Graphic Device Interface Plus (GDI+) JPEG processing
component. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by convincing a victim user to
visit a malicious web site, read an HTML-rendered email message, or
otherwise view a crafted JPEG image with a vulnerable application. No user
intervention is required beyond viewing an attacker-supplied JPEG
image. Any applications (Microsoft or third-party) that use the GDI+ library
to render JPEG images may present additional attack vectors for this
vulnerability. While some applications use the Windows operating system
version of the GDI+ library, other applications may install and use
another version, which may also be vulnerable. Microsoft has created a
GDI+ Detection Tool to help detect products that may contain a vulnerable
version of the JPEG parsing component. Microsoft Knowledge Base
Article 873374 provides instructions on how to download and use this
tool. In addition to running Microsoft's detection utility, we recommend 
searching your system for "gdiplus.dll" to help determine what 
third-party applications may be affected by this vulnerability. Also note 
that applications may re-install a vulnerable version of the 
GDI+ library if re-installed after a patch has been applied. We are tracking this vulnerability in Vulnerability 
Note VU#297462 . This reference number corresponds to CVE candidate CAN-2004-0200 . Impact Remote attackers exploiting the vulnerability described above may
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
software components being attacked. Solution Apply patches from Microsoft Apply the appropriate patches as specified in Microsoft Security
Bulletin MS04-028 .
Please note that this bulletin provides several updates to the operating
system and various applications that rely on GDI+ to render JPEG images.
Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to install multiple
patches. In addition to releasing some patches on Windows Update , Microsoft
has released some patches on Office Update , and
developer tool patches are available from MS04-028 . Apply patches from third-party vendors Third-party software that relies on GDI+ to render JPEG images may
also need to be updated. Apply the appropriate patches specified by
your vendor.  Please see your vendor's site and the Systems Affected
section of the vulnerability note for more information. Depending on
your system's configuration, you may need to install multiple patches. Follow Microsoft recommendations for workarounds Microsoft provides several workarounds for this vulnerability.
Note that these workarounds do not remove the vulnerability from the
system, and they will limit functionality. Please consult the "Workarounds
for JPEG Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0200" section of Microsoft Security
