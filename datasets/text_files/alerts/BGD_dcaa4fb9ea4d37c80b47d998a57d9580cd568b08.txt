The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet through an affected device. The vulnerability does not affect IPv4 traffic and there is no workaround for the vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause the switches management CLI to stop responding.
