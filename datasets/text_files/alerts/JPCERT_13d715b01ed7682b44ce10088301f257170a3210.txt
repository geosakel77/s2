           ISC BIND 9 DoS Vulnerability by caching resolver

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2011/at110014.txt


I. Overview

  ISC BIND 9 contains a vulnerability that will cause a Denial of 
Service (DoS). As a result, a remote attacker could easily initiate a 
Denial of Service (DoS) attack on DNS servers (mainly DNS cache 
servers) running BIND 9. Detailed attack techniques that exploit this 
vulnerability have been published on the Internet.  We recommend 
applying measures based on "III. Solution." For more information about
the vulnerability, refer to the information from Internet Systems 
Consortium, Inc.

Note that servers will be affected by this vulnerability even when 
DNSSEC is disabled.


II. Products Affected

*** Update: Revised on June 1, 2011 **********************************

  The following versions may be affected by this vulnerability.
  ISC BIND

III. Solution

  ISC has released a BIND version that corrects this vulnerability. 
Additionally, corrected versions are also being provided by several 
distributors. We recommend quickly deploying the corrected version 
after thorough testing.

  When an attack that expoilts this vulnerability is successful, error
messages such as the following will be contained in the log file.

    named[
<process number="">
 ]: buffer.c:285: REQUIRE(b-&gt;used + 1 &lt;= b-&gt;length) failed
    named[
 <process number="">
  ]: exiting (due to assertion failure)

Monitor the log file and take measures such as restarting the process 
if necessary.
