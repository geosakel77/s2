              Increased activity targeting TCP port 5168

             http://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2007/at070019.txt

I. Overview

  Using using the Internet Scan Data Acquisition System (ISDAS), 
JPCERT/CC observed that there has been an increase in scans of TCP
port 5168 since August 22, 2007. Although the cause of this increase
in scans is not known, there is a possibility that they are attacks
targeting the vulnerabilities in ServerProtect from Trend Micro, for
which a Security Patch has recently been released.


II. Situation Observed

  For the situation of TCP port 5168 scans observed by the ISDAS,
see the following website:

    ISDAS TCP port 5168 graph (August 22 - 23, 2007)

III. Solution

  Users of services provided through TCP port 5168 are advised to
implement the following measures:

   1) Users of Trend Micro ServerProtect for Windows/NetWare 5.x
      should apply the Security Patch by referring to "IV. Reference
      Information."

   2) To prevent secondary damage, limit the outbound packet traffic
      to TCP port 5168 in case you are infected with a virus.
