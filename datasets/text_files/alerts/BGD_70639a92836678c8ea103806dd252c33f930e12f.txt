Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. IMPACT: Multiple Vulnerabilities have been discovered in iCloud for Windows which could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the affected user. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows: * A type confusion issue was addressed with improved memory handling, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30852) * A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved input validation, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30814) * Processing a maliciously crafted image could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30835, CVE-2021-30847) * An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to bypass HSTS. (CVE-2021-30823) * Multiple memory corruption issues, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2021-30849) Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user, or the bypassing of security restrictions. Depending on the permission associated with the application running the exploit, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * iCloud for Windows versions prior to 13 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate patches provided by Apple to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a nonprivileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Remind users not to download, accept or execute files from untrusted and unknown sources. * Remind users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links provided by untrusted or unknown sources. * Evaluate read, write, and execute permissions on all newly installed software. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
