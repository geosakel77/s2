These incidents are likely to increase in frequency and severity over the coming weeks and months. This is due, in part, to the ease in which existing scam emails and texts can be modified with a COVID-19 theme. Alert status HIGH Opportunistic malicious actors are exploiting people’s concerns and desire for information about the COVID-19 pandemic by directing them towards websites designed to either install malicious software or steal personal information. In the last few weeks, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has observed thousands of COVID-19-related websites being registered. While the majority of these websites are legitimate, many are being created by malicious cyber actors seeking to exploit Australians during this difficult time. The malicious COVID-19 websites are designed to look legitimate or impersonate well-known organisations, making it difficult for individuals to detect. Cybercriminals use them to install computer viruses onto people’s devices, such as banking Trojans or different variants of ransomware, in order to generate profit. In other cases, they seek to harvest user credentials, such as personal identification, passwords and bank details, which are then used to gain access to the user’s networks, devices or online financial accounts. The ACSC, with assistance from our law enforcement and industry partners, is engaged in efforts to disrupt or prevent these malicious COVID-19 themed cyber activities. Ongoing analysis of COVID-19 scams and phishing emails indicates the majority of them are quite sophisticated, often impersonating trusted entities such as the Australian Government. The methods used are constantly evolving, with malicious actors regularly adapting their tradecraft to circumvent attempts to stop them. Those engaged in cybercrime activity are not constrained by geographic borders and their actions can have far-reaching consequences. The ACSC is aware of reports that malicious actors based in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and Africa have been responsible for launching COVID-19 themed malicious cyber activity, including against Australians. The ACSC strongly encourages organisations and individuals to remain vigilant against the threat of COVID-19 themed scams, phishing emails and malicious websites. 22 May 2020 COVID-19 – Remote access to Operational Technology Environments 20 Apr 2020 Threat update: COVID-19 malicious cyber activity 20 April 2020 14 Apr 2020 COVID-19: Cyber security tips when working from home 27 Mar 2020 COVID-19 themed malicious cyber activity 27 Mar 2020 Threat update: COVID-19 malicious cyber activity 27 March 2020 27 Mar 2020 COVID-19 Malicious Scams - Threat Awareness and Guidance 16 Mar 2020 COVID-19 scam messages 13 Mar 2020 Cyber security is essential when preparing for COVID-19 Content written for Individuals & families Small & medium businesses Organisations & critical infrastructure Government View all content First published: 13 Mar 2020 Last updated: 22 May 2020 Share on Was this information helpful?
