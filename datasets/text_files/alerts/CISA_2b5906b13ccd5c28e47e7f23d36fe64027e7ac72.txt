reference number corresponds to CVE candidate CAN-2004-0380. The patches and further information about the vulnerability are
available in Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS04-013 . MS04-013 is titled Cumulative
Security Update for Outlook Express . Since most (if not all)
current Windows systems have Outlook Express installed by default, and the
MHTML protocol handler is part of the Outlook Express software package,
most (if not all) Windows systems should be considered vulnerable. TA04-099A and VU#323070 focused on
the ITS protocol handlers; however, the latent vulnerability appears
to be in the MHTML handler shipped as part of Outlook Express.  These
documents have been updated. Impact Several of the issues identified by Microsoft have been described as Critical in nature. Each bulletin contains at least one vulnerability which may
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
systems. The privileges gained would depend on the security context of
the software and vulnerability exploited. Solution Apply an appropriate set of updates from Microsoft Please see the following site for more information about appropriate remediation.
