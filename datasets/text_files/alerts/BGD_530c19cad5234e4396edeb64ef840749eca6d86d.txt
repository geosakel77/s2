Successful exploitation of this the vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the affected application, which could be either a client like Thunderbird or server like Apache webserver. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of this vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT: A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla’s Network Security Services (NSS), a set of cryptography libraries used to handle signatures and certification validation. Successful exploitation of this the vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the affected application, which could be either a client like Thunderbird (connection with attacker TLS server) or server like Apache webserver (processing client certificate). Per Mozilla: Applications using NSS for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS #7, or PKCS #12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the affected application, which could be either a client like Thunderbird or a server like Apache webserver. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of this vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * If applications used within the organization are known to use SSL/TLS, verify if Mozilla NSS is being used. * Apply the latest patches provided by respective vendors after appropriate testing. * Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
