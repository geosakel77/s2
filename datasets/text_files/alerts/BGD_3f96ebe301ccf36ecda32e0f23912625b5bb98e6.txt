Google Chrome is a web browser used to access the Internet. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. IMPACT Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. These vulnerabilities can be exploited if a user visits, or is redirected to, a specially crafted web page. Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows: Insufficient policy enforcement in iOS (CVE-2020-6558) Use after free in presentation API (CVE-2020-6559) Insufficient policy enforcement in autofill (CVE-2020-6560) Inappropriate implementation in Content Security Policy (CVE-2020-6561) Insufficient policy enforcement in Blink (CVE-2020-6562) Insufficient policy enforcement in intent handling (CVE-2020-6563, CVE-2020-6568) Incorrect security UI in permissions (CVE-2020-6564) Incorrect security UI in Omnibox (CVE-2020-6565, CVE-2020-6571) Insufficient policy enforcement in media (CVE-2020-6566) Insufficient validation of untrusted input in command line handling (CVE-2020-6567) Integer overflow in WebUSB (CVE-2020-6569) Side-channel information leakage in WebRTC (CVE-2020-6570) Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser. Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change, or delete data. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. SYSTEM AFFECTED Google Chrome versions prior to 85.0.4183.83 RECOMMENDATIONS Following actions are recommended to be taken: Apply the stable channel update provided by Google to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
