need to undo it before applying the updates. Please refer to the

IV. Workaround

According to Microsoft, since this vulnerability is affected when
jscript is used as a script engine, the vulnerability can be mitigated
by restricting access to the JScript.dll file.
IE11, IE10, and IE9 use jscript9.dll by default which is not affected
by this vulnerability, but jscript.dll is provided to support older
versions of JScript.
Please test the effects that the workarounds may cause prior to
applying the workarounds, as this may affect when accessing to certain
websites or document files that utilize jscript as the scripting engine.
