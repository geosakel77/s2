             Vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2011/at110025.txt


I. Overview

  Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Adobe Acrobat Reader, a PDF file 
viewing software, and Adobe Acrobat, a PDF file creation and 
conversion software. As a result, a remote attacker could terminate 
Adobe Reader and Acrobat or execute arbitrary code by convincing a 
user to open a specially crafted PDF file.

* When reading in a trusted root certificate via automatic updating 
  functions, etc., applying this updated software will automatically 
  remove DigiNotar's root certificate (DigiNotar Qualified CA) from 
  the list of trusted root certificates in Adobe Reader X (10.x) and 
  Acrobat X (10.x). A trusted root certificate automatic updating 
  function is planned for Adobe Reader 9.x and Acrobat 9.x, but until 
  this function is added, list removal must be performed manually.

  For more information, refer to the Adobe Systems website.
