   Vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-5385, etc.) in Web Servers Using CGI

      https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2016/at160031.html


I. Overview

  Vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-5385, etc.) in web servers that use CGI have
been reported. When a request from a remote device with a Proxy header
is received, an unintended value may be assigned to the server environment
variable, HTTP_PROXY. When these vulnerabilities are exploited, man-in-the-middle
attacks may be performed or a connection to an unauthorized host may
be established.

Software with the following conditions is affected by these vulnerabilities.

  - Web servers or web applications that establish outbound communications
    referencing the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

  For more information on the vulnerabilities and its impact, please 
refer to the following information.
