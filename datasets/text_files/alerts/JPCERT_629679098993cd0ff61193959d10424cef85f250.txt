   Alert regarding DDoS attacks leveraging the monlist function in ntpd
          https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2014/at140001.html


I. Overview

  Older versions of ntpd provided by the NTP project contain a function 
(monlist) to check on the status of the NTP server. This function may be 
leveraged by remote attackers for conducting DDoS attacks.

  NTP typically communicates using UDP, so it is relatively easy to 
spoof the source IP address. In addition, the monlist function replies 
with a fairly large sized response to the source IP address for requests 
to the server. This behavior may allow an attacker to send a request 
packet to a NTP server spoofing the target (source) IP address so that 
the large sized data (response) is sent to the target (Web Site, etc.).

  JPCERT/CC has received reports regarding DDoS attacks leveraging the 
monlist function in ntpd. Also, based on data collected by the internet 
traffic monitoring system (TSUBAME *1) run by JPCERT/CC, an increase in 
packets searching for NTP servers has been observed and believe that 
these attacks may continue.

  Servers or network devices you manage that implement functionality
for a NTP server may be leveraged for a DDoS attack without your knowledge. We
recommend to check servers and network devices that you manage to see if ntpd
is running, and if so, configure them properly.

II. Affected versions

  According to the information provided by the NTP Project, the following 
versions are affected.

  ntpd versions prior to 4.2.7p26
  *) Production versions of 4.2.6.x are all affected
  
  The following command will allow you to verify the ntpd version that is running:
  
  ntpq -c rv

III. Solution

  The NTP Project has released a Development version of ntpd that fixes a 
part of the monlist function to reduce the probability of a DDoS attack. If you
are running a publicly accessible NTP server using ntpd, please consider updating
to a development version that addresses this issue.

  The version that addresses this issue is as follows:

  ntpd 4.2.7p26 (Development)

  If you are not able to upgrade to a Development version, please 
consider the following workarounds.

  - Configure ntpd so that the monlist function is disabled
    Add the following line to ntp.conf
    disable monitor

For information on other workarounds, please refer to the information provided
by CERT/CC

    CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU#348126
    NTP can be abused to amplify denial-of-service attack traffic
    https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/348126

  If you are using a version of ntpd provided by a distributor, please 
refer to the information provided by the distributor.

  Also, if it is unnecessary to provide external access to the NTP service, 
please consider restricting access to the NTP server.
