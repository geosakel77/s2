         Alert regarding increase in scans to TCP port 10000

        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2014/at140038.html


I. Overview

  JPCERT/CC has been observing an increase in scans to TCP port 10000
since September, 2014 on its internet traffic monitoring system
(TSUBAME *1).

TCP port 10000 is commonly used as the default port for Webmin, which
is a web-based system administration tool, and according to the
developer of Webmin, it is vulnerable to the GNU bash vulnerability
that was recently made public.

    Changes since Webmin version 1.700
    http://www.webmin.com/changes-1.710.html

    Vulnerability in GNU Bash
    https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2014/at140037.html

  * JPCERT/CC has verified arbitrary code execution with the
    privileges of Webmin, on an environment where Webmin and a
    vulnerable version of GNU bash was installed. *2 (Default Webmin
    installation running as root)

It has been verified that some responses from the source IP addresses
that conducted scans to TCP port 10000 were likely to be from the
Webmin login screen. As a result, if a server that is running Webmin
is attacked, it may be leveraged by a third-party, and may be a reason
for the increase in the scans to TCP port 10000.

As of October 10, 2014, scans to TCP port 10000 are still on-going,
thus there is a possibility that servers that have not patched or
updated may be attacked and leveraged by a third-party for an
attack. If you are using a vulnerable version of Webmin and GNU bash,
please update according to the information in "III. Solution".

At JPCERT/CC we have contacted the network administrators of the
source IP addresses that we have observed to be leveraged for attacks.

  *1 The name of the Asia / Pacific internet traffic monitoring system  
    https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/tsubame/readme.html
  
  *2 Used Webmin 1.700(RPM) and a version of GNU bash that is affected
     by CVE-2014-6271

  - Webmin
    If you are using a vulnerable version, prior to 1.7000, please
    update to version 1.710, which addresses the vulnerability.
