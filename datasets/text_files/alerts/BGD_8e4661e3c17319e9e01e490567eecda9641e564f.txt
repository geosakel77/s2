Threat actors created in September websites that promoted fake antivirus and security updates for Windows 10. The downloaded malicious files (ZIP archives) contained JavaScript that initiated an intricate infection with the file-encrypting malware. A report from HP’s threat intelligence team notes that Magniber ransomware operators demanded payment of up to $2,500 for home users to receive a decryption tool and recover their files. The strain focuses explicitly on Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds. Windows builds targeted by Magniber (HP) In April 2022, Magniber was seen distributed as a Windows 10 update via a network of malicious websites. In January, the its operators used Chrome and Edge browser updates to push malicious Windows application package files (.APPX). Magniber’s new infection chain In previous campaign, the threat actor used MSI and EXE files. For the recent on, it switched to JavaScript files that had the following names: SYSTEM.Critical.Upgrade.Win10.0.ba45bd8ee89b1.js SYSTEM.Security.Database.Upgrade.Win10.0.jse Antivirus_Upgrade_Cloud.29229c7696d2d84.jse ALERT.System.Software.Upgrade.392fdad9ebab262cc97f832c40e6ad2c.js These files are obfuscated and use a variation of the “DotNetToJScript” technique to execute a .NET file in the system memory, lowering the risk of detection by antivirus products available on the host. The .NET file decodes shellcode that uses its own wrapper to make stealthy syscalls, and injects it into a new process before terminating its own. The shellcode deletes shadow copy files via WMI and disables backup and recovery features through “bcdedit” and “wbadmin.” This increases the chances of getting paid as victims have one less option to recover their files. To perform this action, Magniber uses a bypass for the User Account Control (UAC) feature in Windows. It relies on a mechanism that involves creating of a new registry key that allows specifying a shell command. In a later step, the “fodhelper.exe” utility is executed to run a script for deleting the shadow copies. UAC bypass process (HP) VBScript that deletes shadow copies and disables restore functions (HP) Finally, Magniber encrypts the files on the host and drops the ransom notes containing instructions for the victim to restore their files. Magniber’s new infection chain (HP) HP’s analysts noticed that while Magniber attempts to limit the encryption only to specific file types, the pseudohash it generates during the enumeration isn’t perfect, which results in hash collisions and “collateral damage”, i.e., encrypting non-targeted file types as well. Home users can defend against a ransomware attack by making regular backups for their files and to keep them on an offline storage device. This allows recovery of the data onto a freshly installed operating system. Before restoring the data, users should make sure tha their backups were not been infected. Finally, the ransomware tells the victim about what happened and how they can decrypt their data by dropping an HTML ransom note in every directory that contains an encrypted file. To make sure the user sees the demand, Magniber also opens the note in a web browser. Figure 10 – Magniber ransom note HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF Home users can protect themselves from ransomware campaigns like this one by following this simple advice: Follow the principle of least privilege by only using administrator accounts if you really need to. Many home users have administrator privileges but rarely need them. Download software updates from trusted sources. The campaign depends on tricking people into opening fake software updates. Only download updates from trustworthy sources such as Windows Update and official software vendor websites. Back up your data regularly. Backing up your data will give you peace of mind should the worst happen. CONCLUSION Even though Magniber does not fall into the category of Big Game Hunting, it can still cause significant damage. Home users were the likely target of this malware based on the supported operating system versions and UAC bypass. The attackers used clever techniques to evade protection and detection mechanisms. Most of the infection chain is “fileless”, meaning the malware only resides in memory, reducing the chances of it being detected. Magniber also bypasses detection techniques that rely on user-mode hooks because it uses syscalls instead of standard Windows API libraries. With the UAC bypass, the malware deletes the infected system’s shadow copy files and disables backup and recovery features, preventing the victim from recovering their data using Windows tools.
