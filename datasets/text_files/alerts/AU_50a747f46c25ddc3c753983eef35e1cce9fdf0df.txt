Organisations should act now and follow ACSC’s advice to improve their cyber security resilience in light of the heightened threat environment. Alert status HIGH Background / What has happened? Following the attack on Ukraine, there is a heightened cyber threat environment globally, and the risk of cyber attacks on Australian networks, either directly or inadvertently, has increased. While the ACSC is not aware of any current or specific threats to Australian organisations, adopting an enhanced cyber security posture and increased monitoring for threats will help to reduce the impacts to Australian organisations. A wide range of malicious cyber activity has been detailed in recent partner and industry reporting, including destructive malware, threats to common enterprise solutions, and threats to specific sectors. Organisations should review these publications for information on threats and mitigations relevant to their network. The associated advisory provides further details on these publications. Mitigation / How do I stay secure? The ACSC recommends that organisations urgently adopt an enhanced cyber security posture. This should include reviewing and enhancing detection, mitigation, and response measures. Prioritise taking the following actions across your environment: Patch applications and devices Implement mitigations against phishing and spear phishing attacks Ensure that logging and detection systems are fully updated and functioning Review incident response and business continuity plans. Organisations should review the advisory associated with this alert for additional details on recommended mitigations .
