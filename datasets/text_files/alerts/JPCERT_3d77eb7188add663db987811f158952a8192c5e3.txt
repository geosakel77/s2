If you applied the workaround, then you may need to undo the workaround
before or after applying the security update.

on VGX.DLL, then you must undo this workaround before applying the
security update. 

 - If you applied the workaround to unregister VGX.DLL, you do not have
to undo this workaround before applying the security update. However,
the security update will not re-register vgx.dll, therefore please
re-register vgx.dll.

the workaround before applying the security update. 

**********************************************************************

  Several workarounds have been released from Microsoft. Until the
