Adobe Acrobat and Reader allow a user to view, create, manipulate, print and manage files in Portable Document Format (PDF). Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker executing arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. Impact : Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker executing arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights. System Affected: * Adobe Acrobat DC (Continuous Track) for Windows and Macintosh versions 2018.009.20050 and earlier * Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (Continuous Track) for Windows and Macintosh versions 2018.009.20050 and earlier * Adobe Acrobat 2017 for Windows and Macintosh versions 2017.011.30070 and earlier * Adobe Acrobat Reader 2017 for Windows and Macintosh versions 2017.011.30070 and earlier * Adobe Acrobat DC (Classic Track) for Windows and Macintosh versions 2015.006.30394 and earlier * Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (Classic Track) for Windows and Macintosh versions 2015.006.30394 and earlier Mitigation : The following actions are recommended: Install the updates provided by Adobe immediately after appropriate testing. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. Remind users not to visit websites or follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from untrusted sources. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
