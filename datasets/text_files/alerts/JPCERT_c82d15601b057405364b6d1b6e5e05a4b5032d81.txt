        https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2017/at170016.html


I. Overview
ISC BIND 9 contains multiple vulnerabilities. When these vulnerabilities
are exploited, a remote attacker may cause named to terminate.
ISC has rated the severity of vulnerability CVE-2017-3137 as "High", 
CVE-2017-3136 and CVE-2017-3138 as "Medium". For more details on these
vulnerabilities, please refer to the information provided by ISC.

    CVE-2017-3136: An error handling synthesized records could cause an assertion failure when using DNS64 with "break-dnssec yes;"
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01465/0

    CVE-2017-3137: A response packet can cause a resolver to terminate when processing an answer containing a CNAME or DNAME
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01466/0

    CVE-2017-3138: named exits with a REQUIRE assertion failure if it receives a null command string on its control channel
    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01471/0

If you are operating an affected version of ISC BIND 9 (authoritative
server, recursive server), please consider updating to a version that
addresses these vulnerabilities by referring to the information in
"III. Solution".


II. Affected Systems
According to ISC, the following versions are affected by these
vulnerabilities.

  - CVE-2017-3136 : Medium
    - Versions from 9.9.0 to 9.9.9-P6
    - Versions from 9.10.0 to 9.10.4-P6
    - Versions from 9.11.0 to 9.11.0-P3
    - Servers which have specific configuration ("break-dnssec yes;") 
      and are using DNS64 are also affected
    - Versions 9.8.x which are no longer supported are also affected

  - CVE-2017-3137 : High
    - BIND 9 Version 9.9.9-P6
    - BIND 9 Version 9.10.4-P6
    - BIND 9 Version 9.11.0-P3
    - Recursive resolvers are at highest risk but authoritative servers
      are theoretically vulnerable if they perform recursion

  - CVE-2017-3138 : Medium
    - Versions from 9.9.9 to 9.9.9-P7
    - Versions from 9.10.4 to 9.10.4-P7
