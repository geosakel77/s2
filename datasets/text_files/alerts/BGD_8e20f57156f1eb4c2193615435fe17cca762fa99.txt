This flaw is exploitable by any local user (users and system users, sudoers and non-sudoers), without authentication (i.e., the attacker does not need to know the user’s password). Successful exploitation of this flaw could lead to privilege escalation. SYSTEM AFFECTED The heap-based buffer overflow flaw is present in sudo legacy versions (1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2) and all stable versions (1.9.0 to 1.9.5p1) in their default configuration. RECOMMENDATIONS The bug has been fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2. https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.5p2 REFERENCES https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.5p2 https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156 Share Recommended Posts New PHP information-stealing malware targets Facebook accounts 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Magniber ransomware now infects Windows users via JavaScript files 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts CVE-2022-41352: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical) 16 Oct 2022 - Security Advisories & Alerts Subscribe here Subscribe For Latest Updates Name* Email* Important links National Portal BNDA Post & Telecom Division Access to Information Project Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Public Administration ICT Division MEMBER OF: BGD e-GOV CIRT Bangladesh Computer Council, E-14/X, ICT Tower, Agargaon, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh Contact us Phone: +880255007183 I Email: info@cirt.gov.bd Social Media BGD e-GOV CIRT App
