Description Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-02 describes a number of vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. These vulnerabilities affect Reader and Acrobat 9.2 and earlier 9.x versions, and 8.1.7 and earlier. Further details are available in the US-CERT Vulnerability Notes Database . An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. The Adobe Reader browser plug-in is available for multiple web browsers and operating systems, which can automatically open PDF documents hosted on a website. Some of these vulnerabilities are being actively exploited. Impact These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders to the file system, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service on an affected system as the result of a user opening a malicious PDF document. Solution Update Adobe has released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to read Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-02 and update vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat Disabling JavaScript may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution. Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled using the Preferences menu ( Edit -> Preferences -> JavaScript; un-check Enable Acrobat JavaScript ). Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents The installer for Adobe Reader and Acrobat configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to a safer option that prompts the user by importing the following as a .REG file: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AcroExch.Document.7] "EditFlags"=hex:00,00,00,00 Disable the display of PDF documents in the web browser Preventing PDF documents from opening inside a web browser will partially mitigate this vulnerability. If this workaround is applied it may also mitigate future vulnerabilities. To prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a web browser, do the following: 1. Open Adobe Acrobat Reader. 2. Open the Edit menu. 3. Choose the preferences option. 4. Choose the Internet section. 5. Un-check the " Display PDF in browser " check box. Do not access PDF documents from untrusted sources Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF documents, particularly those hosted on websites or delivered as email attachments.
