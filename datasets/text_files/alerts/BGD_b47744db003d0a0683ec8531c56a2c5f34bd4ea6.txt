Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems. It provides an organized way for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged ones. Polkit is installed by default on all major Linux distributions. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in privilege escalation to root privileges. IMPACT: A vulnerability in Polkit ‘s pkexec component could allow for local privilege escalation. The current version of pkexec doesn’t handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends up trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it’ll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in privilege escalation to root privileges. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * All Linux systems with the policykit package installed * Ubuntu versions 14.04, 16.04, 18.04, 20.04, 21.10 * Debian Distributions * Fedora Distributions * CentOS Distributions * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Extended Lifecycle Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Advanced Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Advanced Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Telco Extended Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 Advanced Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 Telco Extended Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 Update Services for SAP Solutions * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 Update Services for SAP Solutions * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Extended Update Support * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Extended Update Support RECOMMENDATIONS: A vulnerability in Polkit ‘s pkexec component could allow for local privilege escalation. The current version of pkexec doesn’t handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends up trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it’ll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in privilege escalation to root privileges. REFERENCES: We recommend the following actions be taken: Apply appropriate patches to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * If a patch is not available for your distribution of Linux, you can remove the SUID-bit from pkexec as a temporary mitigation: chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec * Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. * Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources.
