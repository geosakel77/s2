             Vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player

            https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2012/at120006.html


I. Overview

  Adobe Flash Player contains multiple vulnerabilities. As a result, a 
remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or perform cross-site 
scripting attacks by convincing a user to open specially crafted 
contents.

  Adobe Systems has already observed targeted attacks exploiting the 
cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2012-0767), and has indicated 
that e-mail containing links leading to attack vector sites are being 
sent.
When a user clicks on a link contained in such e-mails, the attacker 
can impersonate the user and perform actions such as changing the 
user's settings on the website or accessing the user's webmail.

  Users are recommended to update to the corrected software provided 
by Adobe Systems.
