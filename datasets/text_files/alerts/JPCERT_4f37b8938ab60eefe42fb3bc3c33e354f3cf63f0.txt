  Alert Regarding Phishing Scams Targeting Webmail Service Accounts

       https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2021/at210049.html


I. Overview
JPCERT/CC has confirmed an increasing number of reports regarding
phishing scams aiming at stealing account information of Webmail
services. These attacks have been confirmed since early 2020,
but reports have increased since June 2021.

[Figure 1: Number of reports to JPCERT/CC regarding phishing targeting webmail accounts]

These phishing emails spoof to be a maintenance or service notification
of a webmail service. Once recipients connect to a link in the body of
the email, they are directed to a site that impersonates the login
screen of the service. If information such as email address and password
is entered and sent on the site, the attacker may steal these account
information. In addition, the stolen account information can be used by
attackers as a steppingstone to send more phishing emails for their
further attacks.

[Figure 2: Phishing attack procedure and method]

Given these circumstances, JPCERT/CC issued this alert to explain the
attack method and the impact of damage, as well as measures to prevent
and respond to such phishing attacks.


II. Attack techniques
An attacker sends an email impersonating a service provider to direct
recipients of the email to a phishing site in order to steal the
account information of the webmail service. This chapter introduces the
subject and body of emails that have been confirmed so far, and how
these phishing sites look like.
<email and="" body="" subject="">
 The subject and body of the email is about a spoofed notification
regarding Webmail service. Recipients are prompted to click a link on
the email body in Japanese.

[Figure 3: An example of a phishing email]

The following is an example of the email subjects confirmed in November
2021. (originally all in Japanese)

  - Notice of the second release of email plan and security enhancement
  - Update mailbox assignments - [Recipient email address]
  - Accounts flagged for deletion
  - [Notification] Delivery of received email has been suspended - (Recipient email address)
  - [Important] Notice of service suspension - [Recipient email address]
  - [Important] Notice of service restoration on November 8, 2021 (Monday). 
  - [Server upgrade] Notice of maintenance work (November 02, 2021)
 <sender and="" destination="" email="" of="">
  Phishing emails are sent to a wide range of companies, schools,
individuals, etc, and it seems that they are attacking indiscriminately.
Victims' email accounts stolen by these phishing scams are being abused
as the source of emails.
  <characteristics of="" phishing="" site="">
   Upon connecting to a link in the body of these emails, recipients will
be taken to the login screen of a site that spoofs to be a
general Webmail service or some provider email service. If email address
and password is entered, and once Login button is pressed on the site,
the information is sent to the attacker.

[Figure 4: An example of a phishing site login screen (Japanese)]

It is characteristic that the email address of the recipient of the
email is already entered in the username part of the login screen.
It can be considered as a method to trick victims into thinking that
they have visited the page before in the past.

In addition, phishing sites are often set up on compromised legitimate
websites, and access to these compromised websites may not be blocked
by filtering feature of an implemented cybersecurity product.


III. Impact
Email accounts stolen on phishing sites can be used by attackers as
sources of further phishing emails.

The period until it is abused as a source of another phishing email
is very short which is about 1-2 days, and there are reports that
a victim became aware of the damage after their email addresses were
abused as a phishing email sender. This method is called "lateral
phishing" and has the characteristic that the more accounts stolen by
attacks, more capabilities the attackers obtain to deliver phishing
emails.

Other possibilities include email snooping on the stolen email account,
buying and selling of account information, and possibly triggering
other attacks such as business email compromise scams. 


IV. Solution
As with general phishing attack countermeasures, It is recommended to
take the following measures. Also, consider calling attention within
your organization to be aware of such emails.

  (1) Do not click links in the body of the email easily
    - Consider any link in email that leads to a login screen to be suspicious and do not enter password or information

  (2) Check the correct domain name and connect from bookmark
    - Register an online service in the browser bookmark upon starting using the service, then connect from the bookmark

V. Post-compromise response
Victims may become aware of the impact of phishing attacks in situations
such as below:

  - (1) Logging in with ID/Email address and password on the site didn't direct users to the expected page or procedure
  - (2) Logging in with ID/Email address and password caused an error such as incorrect password
  - (3) Unexpected emails are observed to be sent from the email account

If these situations are observed, it is possible that the account
information has been stolen or the account has been compromised.
Therefore, in order to minimize the damage, it is advised to take
the steps as follows:

  - (1) Change the account password and consider using multi-factor authentication if available
  - (2) Change the password of another service account registered with the same password
  - (3) Contact and consult with service providers, etc.
