        Web analytics service exploited for malicious purposes

             https://www.jpcert.or.jp/at/2010/at100028.txt


I. Overview

  From the end of September to mid-October, 2010, JPCERT/CC received 
reports on malware infections that were considered to be transmitted 
through a certain web analytics service. If a user, during the above 
period, viewed a website that uses this analytics service, the user's 
PC may be infected with malware. Since many commercial websites are 
using this web analytics service, a wide range of users may have been 
affected.

*** Update: Added on October 27, 2010 ********************************
* JPCERT/CC has requested the web analytics service provider to 
  investigate this vulnerability to solve the problem. The provider 
  is currently conducting a thorough investigation.
**********************************************************************

JPCERT/CC has confirmed that the malware spread through the web 
analytics service has stopped. However, if a user viewed a 
corresponding website, during the above mentioned period, on a 
PC where vulnerable old software is installed, the PC may have been 
infected with malware. Just in case, make sure that the PC is not 
infected.

Similar attacks may be carried out again. The OS and application 
software should be kept updated by applying patches as necessary.

* Because details of the attacks are not clarified yet, JPCERT/CC is 
  continuing to investigate this problem.


II. Attack Scenario

  A possible attack scenario is as follows:

  1) An attacker injects attacking code in some way in the web 
     analytics service provider's server, so that a user's PC will be 
     infected with malware when a website using this service is 
     displayed.
     - Since many commercial websites are using this web analytics 
       service, a wide range of users may have been affected.

  2) When a user views a corresponding website, the attacking code in 
     1) is executed and the user's PC is infected with malware.
     - It has been confirmed that an existing Java vulnerability is 
       exploited.

  3) The infected PC downloads other malware from external networks 
     and is infected with more than one malware. 

* JPCERT/CC is making arrangements to suspend the sites exploited for 
  malware infections described in 2) and 3).


III. Detection

JPCERT/CC has confirmed that infected PCs contain the files shown 
below. A system containing these files may be infected with malware.

  Files contained in infected PCs:
    - mstmp
    - lib.dll
    - lib.sig
    - AdvBHO.dll

  Example of file search procedure (for Windows XP):
    1) Click Search from the Start menu.
    2) Click "All files and folders" in Search Companion.
    3) Enter a file name in the "All or part of the file name" box, 
       and then click the Search button. 
    4) Check that the above file names are not displayed in the search 
       result.

  * File names which partly match the search terms may be displayed in 
    the search result, for example xxxxlib.dll. These may not be 
    infectious files, so they should be scanned using anti-virus 
    software.

It is possible that files with other names than the above are used for 
attacks. Users are recommended to also scan the entire system with 
anti-virus software.


IV. Solution

  Check whether the PC is infected with malware according to the "III. 
Detection".

  [When infected with malware]
    - Disconnect the PC from the network, and remove the malware 
      following a system administrator's instructions. If it is 
      difficult to remove it, consider performing a clean installation.
     * An infected PC attempts to download other malware from external 
       networks, so it may be infected with more than one malware. 
    - After removing the malware, update the OS and software of the PC 
      to the latest versions.
    - Update anti-virus software pattern files, and ensure that the 
      anti-virus software's virus detection feature is enabled.

  [When not infected with malware]
    - Check that the OS and software installed on the PC is up-to-date. 
      Update them to the latest versions if necessary.
    - Update anti-virus software pattern files, and ensure that the 
      anti-virus software's virus detection feature is enabled.
