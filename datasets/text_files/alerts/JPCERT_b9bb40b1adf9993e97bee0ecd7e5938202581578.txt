disables the Windows File Share Browser and Pulse Secure Collaboration.
After importing, it is recommended to check the settings to see if
Windows File Browser is disabled. For more information and procedures,
please refer to the information on the Pulse Secure advisory.

a tool that checks the integrity of the complete file system and finds

by Pulse Secure for FAQs that summarize how to respond when a threat is
detected by the tool, and how to install and execute the tool.
