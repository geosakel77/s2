  Apple QuickTime contains a vulnerability in Real Time Streaming
Protocol (RTSP) processing which remains unpatched. Exploitation of
this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code on the user's computer. Now, multiple exploit payloads have been
released on the Internet, and attacks using them are expected to
increase in the future.

  Some exploit codes (programs to prove that the vulnerability is
exploitable for attacks) released on the Internet affect QuickTime
running on Windows and Mac OS.


II. Systems Affected

  As of November 30, 2007, this vulnerability has been confirmed to
affect the following products:
