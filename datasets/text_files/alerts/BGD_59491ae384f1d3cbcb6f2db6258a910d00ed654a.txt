DESCRIPTION: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Cisco VPN Routers, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root user of an affected device. These VPN routers are often used to connect hosts via the router hardware as opposed to individual installations on each device. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the root user of an affected device. An attacker could then view, change, or delete data and perform other unauthorized actions on the affected device. IMPACT: Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Cisco VPN Routers, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root user of an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist due to improper validation of HTTP requests to the web-based management interfaces of the affected devices. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. Details of the CVEs have not been released yet, but their IDs are as follows: * CVE-2021-1289 * CVE-2021-1290 * CVE-2021-1291 * CVE-2021-1292 * CVE-2021-1293 * CVE-2021-1294 * CVE-2021-1295 Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the root user of an affected device. An attacker could then view, change, or delete data and perform other unauthorized actions on the affected device. SYSTEM AFFECTED: * RV160 VPN Router w/firmware prior to Release 1.0.01.02 * RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Router w/firmware prior to Release 1.0.01.02 * RV260 VPN Router w/firmware prior to Release 1.0.01.02 * RV260P VPN Router with POE w/firmware prior to Release 1.0.01.02 * RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Router w/firmware prior to Release 1.0.01.02 RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the following actions be taken: * Apply appropriate updates provided by Cisco to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. * Block external access at the network boundary, unless external parties require service. * Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services.
