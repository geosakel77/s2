Summary Description This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government. This malware variant has been identified as KEYMARBLE. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra. DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity. This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation. This malware report contains analysis of one 32-bit Windows executable file, identified as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). This malware is capable of accessing device configuration data, downloading additional files, executing commands, modifying the registry, capturing screen shots, and exfiltrating data.

Connected_To 100.43.153.60 Description This application is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable file, which functions as a RAT. When executed, it de-obfuscates its application programming interfaces (APIs) and using port 443, attempts to connect to the hard-coded IP addresses listed below. After connecting, the malware waits for further instructions. --Begin hard-coded IP addresses-- 100.43.153.60 104.194.160.59 212.143.21.43 --End hard-coded IP addresses-- Static analysis reveals that this RAT uses a customized XOR cryptographic algorithm displayed in Figure 1 to secure its data transfers and command-and-control (C2) sessions. It is designed to accept instructions from the remote server to perform the following functions: --Begin functions-- Download and upload files Execute secondary payloads Execute shell commands Terminate running processes Delete files Search files Set file attributes Create registry entries for storing data:(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WABE\DataPath) Collect device information from installed storage devices (disk free space and their type) List running processes information Capture screenshots Collect and send information about the victim's system (operating system, CPU, MAC address, computer name, language settings, list of disk devices and their type, time elapsed since the system was started, and unique identifier of the victim's system) --End functions-- Screenshots Figure 1 - Screenshot of the cryptographic algorithms the malware used to secure its data transfers and C2 sessions. 100.43.153.60 Ports 443 TCP Whois Domain Name: KRYPT.COM Registry Domain ID: 4620809_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com Registrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com Updated Date: 2016-02-25T03:39:29Z Creation Date: 1998-05-04T04:00:00Z Registry Expiry Date: 2024-05-03T04:00:00Z Registrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC Registrar IANA ID: 146 Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@godaddy.com Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: 480-624-2505 Domain Status: clientDeleteProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited Domain Status: clientRenewProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientRenewProhibited Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited Domain Status: clientUpdateProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientUpdateProhibited Name Server: NS1.CF.KRYPT.COM Name Server: NS2.CF.KRYPT.COM Name Server: NS3.CF.KRYPT.COM DNSSEC: signedDelegation DNSSEC DS Data: 2371 13 2 503AEB51F773BBCA00DB982C938895EF147DDC7D48A4E1E6FD0FE5BE7B98DA0D URL of the ICANN Whois Inaccuracy Complaint Form: https://www.icann.org/wicf/ Last update of whois database: 2018-06-28T02:39:11Z Relationships 100.43.153.60 Connected_From e23900b00ffd67cd8dfa3283d9ced691566df6d63d1d46c95b22569b49011f09 104.194.160.59 Ports 443 TCP Whois Domain Name: SERVPAC.COM Registry Domain ID: 81803816_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com Registrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com Updated Date: 2013-12-27T04:46:10Z Creation Date: 2001-12-31T08:29:34Z Registry Expiry Date: 2018-12-31T08:29:34Z Registrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC Registrar IANA ID: 146 Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@godaddy.com Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: 480-624-2505 Domain Status: clientDeleteProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited Domain Status: clientRenewProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientRenewProhibited Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited Domain Status: clientUpdateProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientUpdateProhibited Name Server: NS1.SERVPAC.COM Name Server: NS2.SERVPAC.COM DNSSEC: unsigned URL of the ICANN Whois Inaccuracy Complaint Form: https://www.icann.org/wicf/ Last update of whois database: 2018-06-28T02:40:41Z Relationships 104.194.160.59 Connected_From e23900b00ffd67cd8dfa3283d9ced691566df6d63d1d46c95b22569b49011f09 212.143.21.43 Ports 443 TCP Whois netnum:        212.143.21.0 - 212.143.21.63 netname:        Nana10-LAN descr:         Nana10-LAN country:        IL admin-c:        NV6695-RIPE tech-c:         NV6695-RIPE status:         ASSIGNED PA mnt-by:         NV-MNT-RIPE created:        2011-02-17T09:16:56Z last-modified: 2011-02-17T09:16:57Z source:         RIPE person:         Nana 10 LTD address:        1 Korazin str address:        Givataim, Israel, 53583 mnt-by:         NV-MNT-RIPE phone:         +972-73-7992000 fax-no:         +972-73-7992220 e-mail:         domains@nana10.net.il nic-hdl:        NV6695-RIPE created:        2010-08-04T09:51:11Z last-modified: 2011-02-17T09:01:21Z source:         RIPE % Information related to '212.143.0.0/16AS1680' route:         212.143.0.0/16 descr:         013 Netvision Network origin:         AS1680 mnt-by:         NV-MNT-RIPE created:        1970-01-01T00:00:00Z last-modified: 2009-03-26T10:55:12Z source:         RIPE Relationships 212.143.21.43 Connected_From e23900b00ffd67cd8dfa3283d9ced691566df6d63d1d46c95b22569b49011f09 Relationship Summary e23900b00f...

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate ACLs.
