Summary Description This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified proxy malware variants used by the North Korean government - referred to by the U.S. Government as ELECTRICFISH. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra. DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity. This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation. This report provides analysis of two malicious 32-bit Windows executable file. The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be tunneled between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows either side to initiate a tunneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and password. This feature allows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised system’s required authentication to reach outside of the network.

Description This file is a malicious Windows 32-bit executable. The application is a command-line utility and its primary purpose is to tunnel traffic between two IP addresses. The application accepts the following command-line arguments, which can be utilized to authenticate with a proxy server: --Begin command-line arguments-- -l,--log [Show Debug Message] -pw,--password [Password] -u,--username [UserName] -do,--domain [DomainName] -p,--proxy [ProxyIP:Port] -d,--destination [TargetIP:Port] -s,--server [LLgcIP:Port] -h,--help [Show this help message] --End command-line arguments-- Displayed below is an example: --Begin Example Usage-- Source IP/Port: 192.0.2.1:92 Dest IP/Port: 198.51.100.1:92 Proxy IP/Port: 203.0.113.1:92 Proxy User Name: test Proxy Password: testpw a12.exe -s 192.0.2.1:92 -d 198.51.100.1:92 -p 203.0.113.1:92 -u test -pw testpw​ --End Example Usage-- It will attempt to establish TCP sessions with the source IP address and the destination IP address. If a connection is made to both the source and destination IPs, this malicious utility will implement a custom protocol, which will allow traffic to rapidly and efficiently be tunneled between two machines. If necessary, the malware can authenticate with a proxy to be able to reach the destination IP address. A configured proxy server is not required for this utility. After the malware authenticates with the configured proxy, it will immediately attempt to establish a session with the destination IP address, located outside of the target network and the source IP address. The header of the initial authentication packet, sent to both the source and destination systems, will be static except for two random bytes. Everything within this 34-byte header is static except for the bytes 0X2B6E, which will change during each connection attempt. Displayed below (and displayed in Figure 7) is the packet header. --Begin Authentication Packet Sent to Destination System-- 6161616162626262636363636464646400000000000000002B6E0000040000009210 --End Authentication Packet Sent to Destination System-- Screenshots Figure 1 - Figure 2 - Figure 3 - Figure 4 - Figure 5 - Figure 6 - Figure 7 - 7cf5d86cc75cd8f0e22e35213a9c051b740bd4667d9879a446f06277782bffd1 Tags trojan Details Name 0BA6BB2AD05D86207B5303657E3F6874 Size 1436160 bytes Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows MD5 0ba6bb2ad05d86207b5303657e3f6874 SHA1 ad44567c8709df4889d381a0a64cc4b49e5004c3 SHA256 7cf5d86cc75cd8f0e22e35213a9c051b740bd4667d9879a446f06277782bffd1 SHA512 cce39d397a661a5b1c7504f4001e1683231b4d8fb77499102c06532b3ec38f775e544493166e75076460f444b27a15a1ab68237ceb26454b934ee6020c2b0e16 ssdeep 24576:NUPhrrn8YtZM9hjGMjxyK9Ws/6oYJt1wY2ZJIZ7IOAZSRpxtwQDCbzEG:qKjGMjQcGsw7IFSRpxtnDCbF Entropy 6.704631 Antivirus AegisLab Trojan.Win32.Alreay.tqBn Ahnlab HackTool/Win32.Agent Antiy Trojan[Banker]/Win32.Alreay Avira TR/AD.Stantinko.ysgqb BitDefender Trojan.GenericKD.32262757Unclassified Cyren W32/Alreay.DVWS-3035 ESET a variant of Win32/NukeSped.FQ trojan Emsisoft Trojan.GenericKD.32262757 (B) Ikarus Trojan.Win32.HackTool K7 Trojan ( 00555fff1 ) Kaspersky Trojan-Banker.Win32.Alreay.gen NANOAV Trojan.Win32.Alreay.fvvzst Quick Heal Trojan.Alreay Sophos Troj/ElecFish-A Symantec Unavailable (production) VirusBlokAda TrojanBanker.Alreay Yara Rules hidden_cobra_consolidated.yara rule electricfish { meta: Author = "CISA trusted 3rd party" Incident = "10135536" Date = "2019-08-14" Category = "Hidden_Cobra" Family = "ELECTRICFISH" Description = "Detects logging functionality" MD5_1 = "0ba6bb2ad05d86207b5303657e3f6874" SHA256_1 = "7cf5d86cc75cd8f0e22e35213a9c051b740bd4667d9879a446f06277782bffd1" strings: $ = "LLgcIP" $ = "CCGC_LOG" $ = "LLGC_LOG" condition: uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and all of them } ssdeep Matches No matches found.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
