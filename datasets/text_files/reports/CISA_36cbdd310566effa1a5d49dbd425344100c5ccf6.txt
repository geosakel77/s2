Summary Description Three files were submitted to CISA for analysis. One file consists of shell scripts designed to modify a Pulse Secure Perl Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script file to become a webshell. The other files are capable of allowing a remote operator to read and write files on the target system. This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices.

Description This file is a Pulse Secure CGI script with malicious code patched in. This file and "healthcheck.cgi" (85f74424fb4c7dba9f2e9c60a95c8a226a97f7dfc277f5ce6f34862a9f500226) have the same malicious code patched in. This file contains a different hard-coded RC4 key for encryption. Recommendations CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
