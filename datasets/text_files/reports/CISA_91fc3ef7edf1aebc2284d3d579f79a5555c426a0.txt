Description This file is a JSP webshell. The file contains the code "eval(window.localStorage.embed)", "DataInputStream(request.getInputStream())", and "DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(v(d.substring(b+2)))" which indicate the JSP file's input is form-data, written in Javascript. Also, that a portion of the Javascript will be encoded in Base64. The client side of this webshell was not available for analysis. The code "Runtime.getRuntime().exec(g)" and "DataInputStream(p.getInputStream())" demonstrate the JSP file's ability to execute commands and upload files, as a byte stream. The code "FileOutputStream(f)", "stream.write(m)", and o="Uploaded: "+f;" shows the ability to send outputs to the client code. Screenshots Figure 1 - This excerpt of code shows the webshell's ability to receive inputs and execute commands. Figure 2 - This excerpt of code shows the webshell's output functionality and Base64 decoding. Recommendations CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
