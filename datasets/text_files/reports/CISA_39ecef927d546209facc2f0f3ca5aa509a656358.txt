Description This file is a JSP webshell that allows an attacker to execute shell commands and read the output of the commands. When executed, it prompts the attacker to enter the shell command to be executed. It checks whether the command supplied by the attacker through the "cmd" parameters contain null values (blank). If it contains null values, the command input stream will be displayed in a JSP page in the format below: --Begin format-- ""Command: " + request.getParameter("cmd") + "<BR>"" --End format-- If the system platform is Windows, it executes the user-provided commands via "cmd.exe /c <commands>". Otherwise, it will execute the user-provided commands in the shell. The command output will be displayed in a JSP page. Screenshots Figure 1 - The contents of the JSP file. It contains a form with input fields that prompts the attacker to enter the command in the input box to execute. Recommendations CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs). Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, "Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops".
