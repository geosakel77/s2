Summary Description This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to provide detailed analysis of files associated with HyperBro, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). CISA obtained HyperBro malware samples during an on-site incident response engagement at a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization compromised by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors. CISA analyzed 4 files associated with HyperBro malware. The files creates a backdoor program that is capable of uploading and downloading files to and from the system. The RAT is also capable of logging keystrokes and executing commands on the system. For more information on the confirmed compromise, see Joint CSA: Impacket and Exfiltration Tool Used to Steal Sensitive Information from Defense Industrial Base Organization .

Created f2ba8b8aabf73020febd3a925276d52ce88f295537fe57723df714c13f5a8780 Description This DLL is side-loaded by df847abbfac55fb23715cde02ab52cbe59f14076f9e4bd15edbe28dcecb2a348 detailed in this report. When the DLL is executed it will create a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) to identify the system to the command and control (C2) during communication. The GUID is written to a file called 'Config.ini' and placed in the current directory. The program will decrypt and read a configuration file called 'thumb.dat' that instructs it to spawn a new instance of the Service Host Process (svchost.exe) and inject itself into the new instance. Svchost.exe is run with the -k netsvcs parameter to allow the malware to connect to its C2. The malware collects the following information to send to the C2 via POST when establishing a connection. ---Begin Collected Information--- Computer Name IP Address Path to the malware location Process name that it is running in (svchost.exe) Mode Name of the malware GUID ---End Collected Information--- During analysis, the malware attempted to connect to the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), hxxps[:]//104.168.236.46/api/v2/ajax using the fixed User-Agent string Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36.

The malware creates a hidden folder called ‘windefenders’ in the path C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ where it will copy the PE file ‘msmpeng.exe’ along with the GUID file, ‘config.ini’, the malicious library ‘vftrace.dll’, and the encrypted configuration file ‘thumb.dat’. A second hidden folder called ‘windefenders’ is also created in the path C:\ProgramData\. This folder holds another instance of the PE file. The program is capable of logging keystrokes, uploading and downloading files, and will also invoke RpcServerListen to wait for incoming Remote Procedure Call (RPC) connections. It will also open a pipe called ‘\Device\NamedPipe\testpipe’ that it uses to pass commands from its daemon to any worker processes it may set up. 104.168.236.46 Tags command-and-control URLs hxxps[:]//104.168.236.46/api/v2/ajax Ports 443 TCP Whois Domain Name: HOSTWINDSDNS.COM Registry Domain ID: 1655837964_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.com Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com Updated Date: 2021-06-25T06:27:14Z Creation Date: 2011-05-12T23:01:53Z Registry Expiry Date: 2029-05-12T23:01:53Z Registrar: NameCheap, Inc.

Created_By 52072a8f99dacd5c293fccd051eab95516d8b880cd2bc5a7e0f4a30d008e22a7 Conclusion The following MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques were observed during analysis of these samples. T1543.003 Persistence: Create or Modify System Process. Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions. Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry. Service configurations can be modified using utilities such as sc.exe and Reg. T1574.002 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading. Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s). T1567.000 Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service. Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services. T1560.000 Collection: Archive Collected Data. An adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration. Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network. Encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender. Recommendations CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
