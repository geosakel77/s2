Summary Description This report contains information obtained from automated analysis and is not intended to be a complete description of the submitted sample. Results may be limited due to the complexity of the samples, or due to the ability of the samples to defend against automated analysis techniques. If additional information is required, please contact the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) using the information provided at the end of this report. CISA received one artifact, ff4138ca9119ab0381ad6575f041e633, which appeared to be a crafted RTF document to perform penetration testing for the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability found in Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010. It is actually an obfuscated RTF that when opened in Microsoft Word, it connected to nanocoatingindonesia.co.id and attempted to download an executable named Specification.exe, copied it over to word.scr and executed it immediately. At the time of this analysis, the domain returned HTTP 404 not found to the HTTP GET request. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MIFR-10079683-1.v2.stix .

Connected_To nanocoatingindonesia.co.id Description FF4138CA9119AB0381AD6575F041E633 is an obfuscated RTF document, appeared to be crafted to perform penetration testing when examined under a hexadecimal editor. Close to the end of file, ASCII data "For pentesting purposes only!" and the MD5 hash value of the RTF were found. However, when the RTF was opened in Microsoft Word, it sent a HTTP GET request to the domain nanocoatingindonesia.co.id in order to download a binary named Specification.exe. If successfully downloaded it would copy Specification.exe to word.scr and immediately execute it. When the RTF was examined under a debugger, the location of word.scr was in the C:\Windows\system32 directory; word.scr ran on the system followed by a system crash and reboot. However, when the RTF was opened without a debugger, word.scr was copied to the same directory where RTF was located at and the system did not crash. At the time of this analysis, nanocoatingindonesia.co.id returned HTTP 404 Not Found to the HTTP GET request for the Specification.exe binary.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. Keep operating system patches up-to-date. Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs). Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, "Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops".
